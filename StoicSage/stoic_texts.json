For we are not now seeking to\ndiscover what is a good, but what good is man's. And if there is no other attribute which belongs\npeculiarly to man except reason, then reason will be his one peculiar good, but a good that is worth\nall the rest put together. If any man is bad, he will, I suppose, be regarded with disapproval; if good,\nI suppose he will be regarded with approval. Therefore, that attribute of man whereby he is\napproved or disapproved is his chief and only good. You do not doubt whether this is a good; you\nmerely doubt whether it is the sole good. If a man possess all other things, such as health, riches,\npedigree, a crowded reception-hall, but is confessedly bad, you will disapprove of him. Likewise, if a\nman possess none of the things which I have mentioned, and lacks money, or an escort of clients,\nor rank and a line of grandfathers and great-grandfathers, but is confessedly good, you will approve\nof him. Hence, this is man's one peculiar good, and the possessor of it is to be praised even if he\nlacks other things; but he who does not possess it, though he possess everything else in\nabundance, is condemned and rejected. The same thing holds good regarding men as regarding\nthings. A ship is said to be good not when it is decorated with costly colours, nor when its prow is\ncovered with silver or gold or its figure-head embossed in ivory, nor when it is laden with the imperial\nrevenues or with the wealth of kings, but when it is steady and staunch and taut, with seams that\nkeep out the water, stout enough to endure the buffeting of the waves' obedient to its helm, swift and\ncaring naught for the winds. You will speak of a sword as good, not when its sword-belt is of gold, or\nits scabbard studded with gems, but when its edge is fine for cutting and its point will pierce any\narmour. Take the carpenter's rule: we do not ask how beautiful it is, but how straight it is. Each thing\nis praised in regard to that attribute which is taken as its standard, in regard to that which is its\npeculiar quality.", "Therefore in the case of man also, it is not pertinent to the question to know how many acres he\nploughs, how much money he has out at interest, how many callers attend his receptions, how\ncostly is the couch on which he lies, how transparent are the cups from which he drinks, but how\ngood he is. He is good, however, if his reason is well-ordered and right and adapted to that which\nhis nature has\nwilled. It is this that is called virtue; this is what we mean by \"honourable\"; it is man's unique good.\nFor since reason alone brings man to perfection, reason alone, when perfected, makes man happy.\nThis, moreover, is man's only good, the only means by which he is made happy. We do indeed say\nthat those things also are goods which are furthered and brought together by virtue, ? that is, all the\nworks of virtue; but virtue itself is for this reason the only good, because there is no good without\nvirtue. If every good is in the soul, then whatever strengthens, uplifts, and enlarges the soul, is a\ngood; virtue, however, does make the soul stronger, loftier, and larger. For all other things, which\narouse our desires, depress the soul and weaken it, and when we think that they are uplifting the\nsoul, they are merely puffing it up and cheating it with much emptiness. Therefore, that alone is\ngood which will make the soul better.", "All the actions of life, taken as a whole, are controlled by the consideration of what is honourable or\nbase; it is with reference to these two things that our reason is governed in doing or not doing a\nparticular thing. I shall explain what I mean: A good man will do what he thinks it will be honourable\nfor him to do, even if it involves toil; he will do it even if it involves harm to him; he will do it even if it\ninvolves peril; again, he will not do that which will be base, even if it brings him money, or pleasure,\nor power. Nothing will deter him from that which is honourable, and nothing will tempt him into\nbaseness. Therefore, if he is determined invariably to follow that which is honourable, invariably to\navoid baseness, and in every act of his life to have regard for these two things, deeming nothing\nelse good except that which is honourable, and nothing else bad except that which is base; if virtue\nalone is unperverted in him and by itself keeps its even course, then virtue is that man's only good,\nand nothing can thenceforth happen to it which may make it anything else than good. It has escaped\nall risk of change; folly may creep upwards towards wisdom, but wisdom never slips back into folly.", "You may perhaps remember my saying that the things which have been generally desired and\nfeared have been trampled down by many a man in moments of sudden passion. There have been\nfound men who would place their hands in the flames, men whose smiles could not be stopped by\nthe torturer, men who would shed not a tear at the funeral of their children, men who would meet\ndeath unflinchingly. It is love, for example, anger, lust, which have challenged dangers. If a\nmomentary stubbornness can accomplish all this when roused by some goad that pricks the spirit,\nhow much more can be accomplished by virtue, which does not act impulsively or suddenly, but\nuniformly and with a strength that is lasting! It follows that the things which are often scorned by the\nmen who are moved with a sudden passion, and are always scorned by the wise, are neither goods\nnor evils. Virtue itself is therefore the only good; she marches proudly between the two extremes of\nfortune, with great scorn for both.", "If, however, you accept the view that there is anything good besides that which is honourable, all the\nvirtues will suffer. For it will never be possible for any virtue to be won and held, if there is anything\noutside itself which virtue must take into consideration. If there is any such thing, then it is at\nvariance with reason, from which the virtues spring, and with truth also, which cannot exist without\nreason. Any opinion, however, which is at variance with truth, is wrong. A good man, you will admit,\nmust have the highest sense of duty toward the gods. Hence he will endure with an unruffled spirit\nwhatever happens to him; for he will know that it has happened as a result of the divine law, by\nwhich the whole creation moves. This being so, there will be for him one good, and only one,\nnamely, that which is honourable; for one of its dictates is that we shall obey the gods and not blaze\nforth in anger at sudden misfortunes or deplore our lot, but rather patiently accept fate and obey its\ncommands. If anything except the honourable is good, we shall be hounded by greed for life, and by\ngreed for the things which provide life with its furnishings, ? an intolerable state, subject to no limits,\nunstable. The only good, therefore, is that which is honourable, that which is subject to bounds.", "I have declared that man's life would be more blest than that of the gods, if those things which the\ngods do not enjoy are goods, ? such as money and offices of dignity. There is this further\nconsideration: if only it is true that our souls, when released from the body, still abide, a happier\ncondition is in store for them than is theirs while they dwell in the body. And yet, if those things are\ngoods which we make use of for our bodies' sake, our souls will be worse off when set free; and that\nis contrary to our belief, to say that the soul is happier when it is cabined and confined than when it\nis free and has betaken itself to the universe. I also said that if those things which dumb animals\npossess equally with man are goods, then dumb animals also will lead a happy life; which is of\ncourse impossible. One must endure all things in defence of that which is honourable; but this would\nnot be necessary if there existed any other good besides that which is honourable.", "Although this question was discussed by me pretty extensively in a previous letter, I have discussed\nit summarily and briefly run through the argument. But an opinion of this kind will never seem true to\nyou unless you exalt your mind and ask yourself whether, at the call of duty, you would be willing to\ndie for your country, and buy the safety of all your fellow-citizens at the price of your own; whether\nyou would offer your neck not only with patience, but also with gladness. If you would do this, there\nis no other good in your eyes. For you are giving up everything in order to acquire this good.\nConsider how great is the power of that which is honourable: you will die for your country, even at a\nmoment's notice, when you know that you ought to do so. Sometimes, as a result of noble conduct,\none wins great joy even in a very short and fleeting space of time; and though none of the fruits of a\ndeed that has been done will accrue to the doer after he is dead and removed from the sphere of\nhuman affairs, yet the mere contemplation of a deed that is to be done is a delight, and the brave\nand upright man, picturing to himself the guerdons of his death, ? guerdons such as the freedom of\nhis country and the deliverance of all those for whom he is paying out his life, ? partakes of the\ngreatest pleasure and enjoys the fruit of his own peril. But that man also who is deprived of this joy,\nthe joy which is afforded by the contemplation of some last noble effort, will leap to his death without\na moment's hesitation, content to act rightly and dutifully. Moreover, you may confront him with\nmany discouragements; you may say: \"Your deed will speedily be forgotten,\" or \"Your fellow-citizens\nwill offer you scant thanks.\" He will answer: \"All these matters lie outside my task. My thoughts are\non the deed itself. I know that this is honourable. Therefore, whithersoever I am led and summoned\nby honour, I will go.\"", "This, therefore, is the only good, and not only is every soul that has reached perfection aware of it,\nbut also every soul that is by nature noble and of right instincts; all other goods are trivial and\nmutable. For this reason we are harassed if we possess them. Even though, by the kindness of\nFortune, they have been heaped together, they weigh heavily upon their owners, always pressing\nthem down and sometimes crushing them. None of those whom you behold clad in purple is happy,\nany more than one of these actors upon whom the play bestows a sceptre and a cloak while on the\nstage; they strut their hour before a crowded house, with swelling port and buskined foot; but when\nonce they make their exit the foot-gear is removed and they return to their proper stature. None of\nthose who have been raised to a loftier height by riches and honours is really great. Why then does\nhe seem great to you? It is because you are measuring the pedestal along with the man. A dwarf is\nnot tall, though he stand upon a mountain-top; a colossal statue will still be tall, though you place it\nin a well. This is the error under which we labour; this is the reason why we are imposed upon: we\nvalue no man at what he is, but add to the man himself the trappings in which he is clothed. But\nwhen you wish to inquire into a man's true worth, and to know what manner of man he is, look at\nhim when he is naked; make him lay aside his inherited estate, his titles, and the other deceptions of\nfortune; let him even strip off his body. Consider his soul, its quality and its stature, and thus learn\nwhether its greatness is borrowed, or its own.", "If a man can behold with unflinching eyes the flash of a sword, if he knows that it makes no\ndifference to him whether his soul takes flight through his mouth or through a wound in his throat,\nyou may call him happy; you may also call him happy if, when he is threatened with bodily torture,\nwhether it be the result of accident or of the might of the stronger, he can without concern hear talk\nof chains, or of exile, or of all the idle fears that stir men's minds, and can say:", "Springs up before my eyes; within my soul\nI have forestalled and surveyed everything.", "Think continually how many physicians are dead after often contracting their eyebrows over the sick;\nand how many astrologers after predicting with great pretensions the deaths of others; and how\nmany philosophers after endless discourses on death or immortality; how many heroes after killing\nthousands; and how many tyrants who have used their power over men's lives with terrible\ninsolence as if they were immortal; and how many cities are entirely dead, so to speak, Helice and\nPompeii and Herculaneum, and others innumerable. Add to the reckoning all whom thou hast\nknown, one after another. One man after burying another has been laid out dead, and another\nburies him: and all this in a short time. To conclude, always observe how ephemeral and worthless\nhuman things are, and what was yesterday a little mucus to-morrow will be a mummy or ashes.\nPass then through this little space of time conformably to nature, and end thy journey in content, just\nas an olive falls off when it is ripe, blessing nature who produced it, and thanking the tree on which it\ngrew.", "To-day it is you who threaten me with these terrors; but I have always threatened myself with them,\nand have prepared myself as a man to meet man's destiny.\" If an evil has been pondered\nbeforehand, the blow is gentle when it comes. To the fool, however, and to him who trusts in\nfortune, each event as it arrives \"comes in a new and sudden form,\" and a large part of evil, to the\ninexperienced, consists in its novelty. This is proved by the fact that men endure with greater\ncourage, when they have once become accustomed to them, the things which they had at first\nregarded as hardships. Hence, the wise man accustoms himself to coming trouble, lightening by\nlong reflection the evils which others lighten by long endurance. We sometimes hear the\ninexperienced say: \"I knew that this was in store for me.\" But the wise man knows that all things are\nin store for him. Whatever happens, he says: \"I knew it.\" Farewell.", "Suddenly there came into our view to-day the \"Alexandrian\" ships, ? I mean those which are usually\nsent ahead to announce the coming of the fleet; they are called \"mail-boats.\" The Campanians are\nglad to see them; all the rabble of Puteoli stand on the docks, and can recognize the \"Alexandrian\"\nboats, no matter how great the crowd of vessels, by the very trim of their sails. For they alone may\nkeep spread their topsails, which all ships use when out at sea, because nothing sends a ship along\nso well as its upper canvas; that is where most of the speed is obtained. So when the breeze has\nstiffened and becomes stronger than is comfortable, they set their yards lower; for the wind has less\nforce near the surface of the water. Accordingly, when they have made Capreae and the headland\nwhence", "all other vessels are bidden to be content with the mainsail, and the topsail stands out\nconspicuously on the \"Alexandrian\" mail-boats.", "While everybody was bustling about and hurrying to the water-front, I felt great pleasure in my\nlaziness, because, although I was soon to receive letters from my friends, I was in no hurry to know\nhow my affairs were progressing abroad, or what news the letters were bringing; for some time now\nI have had no losses, nor gains either. Even if I were not an old man, I could not have helped feeling\npleasure at this; but as it is, my pleasure was far greater. For, however small my possessions might\nbe, I should still have left over more travelling-money than journey to travel, especially since this\njourney upon which we have set out is one which need not be followed to the end. An expedition will\nbe incomplete if one stops half-way, or anywhere on this side of one's destination; but life is not\nincomplete if it is honourable. At whatever point you leave off living, provided you leave off nobly,\nyour life is a whole. Often, however, one must leave off bravely, and our reasons therefore need not\nbe momentous; for neither are the reasons momentous which hold us here.", "Tullius Marcellinus, a man whom you knew very well, who in youth was a quiet soul and became old\nprematurely, fell ill of a disease which was by no means hopeless; but it was protracted and\ntroublesome, and it demanded much attention; hence he began to think about dying. He called\nmany of his friends together. Each one of them gave Marcellinus advice, ? the timid friend urging\nhim to do what he had made up his mind to do; the flattering and wheedling friend giving counsel\nwhich he supposed would be more pleasing to Marcellinus when he came to think the matter over;\nbut our Stoic friend, a rare man, and, to praise him in language which he deserves, a man of\ncourage and vigour admonished him best of all, as it seems to me. For he began as follows: \"Do not\ntorment yourself, my dear Marcellinus, as if the question which you are weighing were a matter of\nimportance. It is not an important matter to live; all your slaves live, and so do all animals; but it is\nimportant to die honourably, sensibly, bravely. Reflect how long you have been doing the same\nthing: food, sleep, lust, ? this is one's daily round. The desire to die may be felt, not only by the\nsensible man or the brave or unhappy man, but even by the man who is merely surfeited.\"", "Marcellinus did not need someone to urge him, but rather someone to help him; his slaves refused\nto do his bidding. The Stoic therefore removed their fears, showing them that there was no risk\ninvolved for the household except when it was uncertain whether the master's death was self-sought\nor not; besides, it was as bad a practice to kill one's master as it was to prevent him forcibly from\nkilling himself. Then he suggested to Marcellinus himself that it would be a kindly act to distribute\ngifts to those who had attended him throughout his whole life, when that life was finished, just as,\nwhen a banquet is finished, the remaining portion is divided among the attendants who stand about\nthe table. Marcellinus was of a compliant and generous disposition, even when it was a question of\nhis own property; so he distributed little sums among his sorrowing slaves, and comforted them\nbesides. No need had he of sword or of bloodshed; for three days he fasted and had a tent put up in\nhis very bedroom. Then a tub was brought in; he lay in it for a long time, and, as the hot water was\ncontinually poured over him, he gradually passed away, not without a feeling of pleasure, as he\nhimself remarked, ? such a feeling as a slow dissolution is wont to give. Those of us who have ever\nfainted know from experience what this feeling is.", "This little anecdote into which I have digressed will not be displeasing to you. For you will see that\nyour friend departed neither with difficulty nor with suffering. Though he committed suicide, yet he\nwithdrew most gently, gliding out of life. The anecdote may also be of some use; for often a crisis\ndemands just such examples. There are times when we ought to die and are unwilling; sometimes\nwe die and are unwilling. No one is so ignorant as not to know that we must at some time die;\nnevertheless, when one draws near death, one turns to flight, trembles, and laments. Would you not\nthink him an utter fool who wept because he was not alive a thousand years ago? And is he not just\nas much of a fool who weeps because he will not be alive a thousand years from now? It is all the\nsame; you will not be, and you were not. Neither of these periods of time belongs to you. You have\nbeen cast upon this point of time; if you would make it longer, how much longer shall you make it?\nWhy weep? Why pray?

Think of the\nmultitudes of men doomed to death who will come after you, of the multitudes who will go with you!\nYou would die more bravely, I suppose, in the company of many thousands; and yet there are many\nthousands, both of men and of animals, who at this very moment, while you are irresolute about\ndeath, are breathing their last, in their several ways.

You wish to\nlive; well, do you know how to live? You are afraid to die. But come now: is this life of yours anything\nbut death? Gaius Caesar was passing along the Via Latina, when a man stepped out from the ranks\nof the prisoners, his grey beard hanging down even to his breast, and begged to be put to death.\n\"What!\" said Caesar, \"are you alive now?\" That is the answer which should be given to men to\nwhom death would come as a relief. \"You are afraid to die; what! are you alive now?\" \"But,\" says\none, \"I wish to live, for I am engaged in many honourable pursuits.

You are deserting no duty; for there is no definite number established which you are bound\nto complete. There is no life that is not short.

But I finally succumbed, and arrived at such a state\nthat I could do nothing but snuffle, reduced as I was to the extremity of thinness.

Honourable consolation results in a cure; and\nwhatever has uplifted the soul helps the body also. My studies were my salvation. I place it to the\ncredit of philosophy that I recovered and regained my strength. I owe my life to philosophy, and that\nis the least of my obligations! My friends, too, helped me greatly toward good health; I used to be\ncomforted by their cheering words, by the hours they spent at my bedside, and by their\nconversation. Nothing, my excellent Lucilius, refreshes and aids a sick man so much as the affection\nof his friends; nothing so steals away the expectation and the fear of death. In fact, I could not\nbelieve that, if they survived me, I should be dying at all. Yes, I repeat, it seemed to me that I should\ncontinue to live, not with them, but through them. I imagined myself not to be yielding up my soul,\nbut to be making it over to them.", "All these things gave me the inclination to succour myself and to endure any torture; besides, it is a\nmost miserable state to have lost one's zest for dying, and to have no zest in living. These, then, are\nthe remedies to which you should have recourse. The physician will prescribe your walks and your\nexercise; he will warn you not to become addicted to idleness, as is the tendency of the inactive\ninvalid; he will order you to read in a louder voice and to exercise your lungs the passages and\ncavity of which are affected; or to sail and shake up your bowels by a little mild motion; he will\nrecommend the proper food, and the suitable time for aiding your strength with wine or refraining\nfrom it in order to keep your cough from being irritated and hacking. But as for me, my counsel to\nyou is this, ? and it is a cure, not merely of this disease of yours, but of your whole life, ? \"Despise\ndeath.\" There is no sorrow in the world, when we have escaped from the fear of death. There are\nthese three serious elements in every disease: fear of death, bodily pain, and interruption of\npleasures. Concerning death enough has been said, and I shall add only a word: this fear is not a\nfear of disease, but a fear of nature. Disease has often postponed death, and a vision of dying has\nbeen many a man's salvation. You will die, not because you are ill, but because you are alive; even\nwhen you have been cured, the same end awaits you; when you have recovered, it will be not\ndeath, but ill-health, that you have escaped.", "Let us now return to the consideration of the characteristic disadvantage of disease: it is\naccompanied by great suffering. The suffering, however, is rendered endurable by interruptions; for\nthe strain of extreme pain must come to an end. No man can suffer both severely and for a long\ntime; Nature, who loves us most tenderly, has so constituted us as to make pain either endurable or\nshort. The severest pains have their seat in the most slender parts of our body; nerves, joints, and\nany other of the narrow passages, hurt most cruelly when they have developed trouble within their\ncontracted spaces. But these parts soon become numb, and by reason of the pain itself lose the\nsensation of pain, whether because the life-force, when checked in its natural course and changed\nfor the worse, loses the peculiar power through which it thrives and through which it warns us, or\nbecause the diseased humours of the body, when they cease to have a place into which they may\nflow, are thrown back upon themselves, and deprive of sensation the parts where they have caused\ncongestion. So gout, both in the feet and in the hands, and all pain in the vertebrae and in the\nnerves, have their intervals of rest at the times when they have dulled the parts which they before\nhad tortured; the first twinges, in all such cases, are what cause the distress, and their onset is\nchecked by lapse of time, so that there is an end of pain when numbness has set in. Pain in the\nteeth, eyes, and ears is most acute for the very reason that it begins among the narrow spaces of\nthe body, ? no less acute, indeed, than in the head itself. But if it is more violent than usual, it turns\nto delirium and stupor. This is, accordingly, a consolation for excessive pain, ? that you cannot help\nceasing to feel it if you feel it to excess. The reason, however, why the inexperienced are impatient\nwhen their bodies suffer is, that they have not accustomed themselves to be contented in spirit.\nThey have been closely associated with the body. Therefore a high-minded and sensible man\ndivorces soul from body, and dwells much with the better or divine part, and only as far as he must\nwith this complaining and frail portion.", "\"But it is a hardship,\" men say, \"to do without our customary pleasures, ? to fast, to feel thirst and\nhunger.\" These are indeed serious when one first abstains from them. Later the desire dies down,\nbecause the appetites themselves which lead to desire are wearied and forsake us; then the\nstomach becomes petulant, then the food which we craved before becomes hateful. Our very wants\ndie away. But there is no bitterness in doing without that which you have ceased to desire.\nMoreover, every pain sometimes stops, or at any rate slackens; moreover, one may take\nprecautions against its return, and, when it threatens, may check it by means of remedies. Every\nvariety of pain has its premonitory symptoms; this is true, at any rate, of pain that is habitual and\nrecurrent. One can endure the suffering which disease entails, if one has come to regard its results\nwith scorn. But do not of your own accord make your troubles heavier to bear and burden yourself\nwith complaining. Pain is slight if opinion has added nothing to it; but if, on the other hand, you begin\nto encourage yourself and say, \"It is nothing, ? a trifling matter at most; keep a stout heart and it will\nsoon cease\"; then in thinking it slight, you will make it slight. Everything depends on opinion;\nambition, luxury, greed, hark back to opinion. It is according to opinion that we suffer. A man is as\nwretched as he has convinced himself that he is. I hold that we should do away with complaint about\npast sufferings and with all language like this: \"None has ever been worse off than I. What\nsufferings, what evils have I endured! No one has thought that I shall recover. How often have my\nfamily bewailed me, and the physicians given me over! Men who are placed on the rack are not torn\nasunder with such agony!\" However, even if all this is true, it is over and gone. What benefit is there\nin reviewing past sufferings, and in being unhappy, just because once you were unhappy? Besides,\nevery one adds much to his own ills, and tells lies to himself. And that which was bitter to bear is\npleasant to have borne; it is natural to rejoice at the ending of one's ills.", "Two elements must therefore be rooted out once for all, ? the fear of future suffering, and the\nrecollection of past suffering; since the latter no longer concerns me, and the former concerns me\nnot yet. But when set in the very midst of troubles one should say:", "Unhappy am I because this has happened to me.- Not so, but happy am I, though this has\nhappened to me, because I continue free from pain, neither crushed by the present nor fearing the\nfuture. For such a thing as this might have happened to every man; but every man would not have\ncontinued free from pain on such an occasion. Why then is that rather a misfortune than this a good\nfortune? And dost thou in all cases call that a man's misfortune, which is not a deviation from man's\nnature? And does a thing seem to thee to be a deviation from man's nature, when it is not contrary\nto the will of man's nature? Well, thou knowest the will of nature. Will then this which has happened\nprevent thee from being just, magnanimous, temperate, prudent, secure against inconsiderate\nopinions and falsehood; will it prevent thee from having modesty, freedom, and everything else, by\nthe presence of which man's nature obtains all that is its own? Remember too on every occasion\nwhich leads thee to vexation to apply this principle: not that this is a misfortune, but that to bear it\nnobly is good fortune.", "Let such a man fight against them with all his might: if he once gives way, he will be vanquished; but\nif he strives against his sufferings, he will conquer. As it is, however, what most men do is to drag\ndown upon their own heads a falling ruin which\nthey ought to try to support. If you begin to withdraw your support from that which thrusts toward you\nand totters and is ready to plunge, it will follow you and lean more heavily upon you; but if you hold\nyour ground and make up your mind to push against it, it will be forced back. What blows do athletes\nreceive on their faces and all over their bodies! Nevertheless, through their desire for fame they\nendure every torture, and they undergo these things not only because they are fighting but in order\nto be able to fight. Their very training means torture. So let us also win the way to victory in all our\nstruggles, ? for the reward is not a garland or a palm or a trumpeter who calls for silence at the\nproclamation of our names, but rather virtue, steadfastness of soul, and a peace that is won for all\ntime, if fortune has once been utterly vanquished in any combat. You say, \"I feel severe pain.\" What\nthen; are you relieved from feeling it, if you endure it like a woman? Just as an enemy is more\ndangerous to a retreating army, so every trouble that fortune brings attacks us all the harder if we\nyield and turn our backs. \"But the trouble is serious.\" What? Is it for this purpose that we are strong,\n? that we may have light burdens to bear? Would you have your illness long-drawn-out, or would\nyou have it quick and short? If it is long, it means a respite, allows you a period for resting yourself,\nbestows upon you the boon of time in plenty; as it arises, so it must also subside. A short and rapid\nillness will do one of two things: it will quench or be quenched. And what difference does it make\nwhether it is not or I am not? In either case there is an end of pain.", "This, too, will help ? to turn the mind aside to thoughts of other things and thus to depart from pain.\nCall to mind what honourable or brave deeds you have done; consider the good side of your own\nlife. Run over in your memory those things which you have particularly admired. Then think of all the\nbrave men who have conquered pain: of him who continued to read his book as he allowed the\ncutting out of varicose veins; of him who did not cease to smile, though that very smile so enraged\nhis torturers that they tried upon him every instrument of their cruelty. If pain can be conquered by a\nsmile, will it not be conquered by reason? You may tell me now of whatever you like ? of colds, hard\ncoughing-spells that bring up parts of our entrails, fever that parches our very vitals, thirst, limbs so\ntwisted that the joints protrude in different directions; yet worse than these are the stake, the rack,\nthe red-hot plates, the instrument that reopens wounds while the wounds themselves are still\nswollen and that drives their imprint still deeper. Nevertheless there have been men who have not\nuttered a moan amid these tortures. \"More yet!\" says the torturer; but the victim has not begged for\nrelease. \"More yet!\" he says again; but no answer has come. \"More yet!\" the victim has smiled, and\nheartily, too. Can you not bring yourself, after an example like this, to make a mock at pain?", "\"But,\" you object, \"my illness does not allow me to be doing anything; it has withdrawn me from all\nmy duties.\" It is your body that is hampered by ill-health, and not your soul as well. It is for this\nreason that it clogs the feet of the runner and will hinder the handiwork of the cobbler or the artisan;\nbut if your soul be habitually in practice, you will plead and teach, listen and learn, investigate and\nmeditate. What more is necessary? Do you think that you are doing nothing if you possess\nself-control in your illness? You will be showing that a disease can be overcome, or at any rate\nendured. There is, I assure you, a place for virtue even upon a bed of sickness. It is not only the\nsword and the battle-line that prove the soul alert and unconquered by fear; a man can display\nbravery even when wrapped in his bed-clothes. You have something to do: wrestle bravely with\ndisease. If it shall compel you to nothing, beguile you to nothing, it is a notable example that you\ndisplay. O what ample matter were there for renown, if we could have spectators of our sickness! Be\nyour own spectator; seek your own applause.", "Again, there are two kinds of pleasures. Disease checks the pleasures of the body, but does not do\naway with them. Nay, if the truth is to be considered, it serves to excite them; for the thirstier a man\nis, the more he enjoys a drink; the hungrier he is, the more pleasure he takes in food. Whatever falls\nto one's lot after a period of abstinence is welcomed with greater zest. The other kind, however, the\npleasures of the mind, which are higher and less uncertain, no physician can refuse to the sick man.\nWhoever seeks these and knows well what they are, scorns all the blandishments of the senses.\nMen say, \"Poor sick fellow!\" But why? Is it because he does not mix snow with his wine, or because\nhe does not revive the chill of his drink ? mixed as it is in a good-sized bowl ? by chipping ice into it?\nOr because he does not have Lucrine oysters opened fresh at his table? Or because there is no din\nof cooks about his dining-hall, as they bring in their very cooking apparatus along with their viands?\nFor luxury has already devised this fashion ? of having the kitchen accompany the dinner, so that\nthe food may not grow luke-warm, or fail to be hot enough for a palate which has already become\nhardened. \"Poor sick fellow!\" ? he will eat as much as he can digest. There will be no boar lying\nbefore his eyes, banished from the table as if it were a common meat; and on his sideboard there\nwill be heaped together no breast-meat of birds, because it sickens him to see birds served whole.\nBut what evil has been done to you? You will dine like a sick man, nay, sometimes like a sound\nman.", "All these things, however, can be easily endured ? gruel, warm water, and anything else that seems\ninsupportable to a fastidious man, to one who is wallowing in luxury, sick in soul rather than in body\n? if only we cease to shudder at death. And we shall cease, if once we have gained a knowledge of\nthe limits of good and evil; then, and then only, life will not weary us, neither will death make us\nafraid. For surfeit of self can never seize upon a life that surveys all the things which are manifold,\ngreat, divine; only idle leisure is wont to make men hate their lives. To one who roams through the\nuniverse, the truth can never pall; it will be the untruths that will cloy. And, on the other hand, if\ndeath comes near with its summons, even though it be untimely in its arrival, though it cut one off in\none's prime, a man has had a taste of all that the longest life can give. Such a man has in great\nmeasure come to understand the universe. He knows that honourable things do not depend on time\nfor their growth; but any life must seem short to those who measure its length by pleasures which\nare empty and for that reason unbounded.", "Refresh yourself with such thoughts as these, and meanwhile reserve some hours for our letters.\nThere will come a time when we shall be united again and brought together; however short this time\nmay be, we shall make it long by knowing how to employ it. For, as Posidonius says: \"A single day\namong the learned lasts longer than the longest life of the ignorant.\" Meanwhile, hold fast to this\nthought, and grip it close: yield not to adversity; trust not to prosperity; keep before your eyes the full\nscope of Fortune's power, as if she would surely do whatever is in her power to do. That which has\nbeen long expected comes more gently. Farewell.", "I have been awaiting a letter from you, that you might inform me what new matter was revealed to\nyou during your trip round Sicily, and especially that you might give me further information regarding\nCharybdis itself. I know very well that Scylla is a rock ? and indeed a rock not dreaded by mariners;\nbut with regard to Charybdis I should like to have a full description, in order to see whether it agrees\nwith the accounts in mythology; and, if you have by chance investigated it (for it is indeed worthy of\nyour investigation), please enlighten me concerning the following: Is it lashed into a whirlpool by a\nwind from only one direction, or do all storms alike serve to disturb its depths? Is it true that objects\nsnatched downwards by the whirlpool in that strait are carried for many miles under water, and then\ncome to the surface on the beach near Tauromenium? If you will write me a full account of these\nmatters, I shall then have the boldness to ask you to perform another task, ? also to climb Aetna at\nmy special request. Certain naturalists have inferred that the mountain is wasting away and\ngradually settling, because sailors used to be able to see it from a greater distance. The reason for\nthis may be, not that the height of the mountain is decreasing, but because the flames have become\ndim and the eruptions less strong and less copious, and because for the same reason the smoke\nalso is less active by day. However, either of these two things is possible to believe: that on the one\nhand the mountain is growing smaller because it is consumed from day to day, and that, on the\nother hand, it remains the same in size because the mountain is not devouring itself, but instead of\nthis the matter which seethes forth collects in some subterranean valley and is fed by other material,\nfinding in the mountain itself not the food which it requires, but simply a passage-way out. There is a\nwell-known place in Lycia ? called by the inhabitants \"Hephaestion\" ? where the ground is full of\nholes in many places and is surrounded by a harmless fire, which does no injury to the plants that\ngrow there. Hence the place is fertile and luxuriant with growth, because the flames do not scorch\nbut merely shine with a force that is mild and feeble.", "But let us postpone this discussion, and look into the matter when you have given me a description\njust how far distant the snow lies from the crater, ? I mean the snow which does not melt even in\nsummer, so safe is it from the adjacent fire. But there is no ground for your charging this work to my\naccount; for you were about to gratify your own craze for fine writing, without a commission from\nanyone at all. Nay, what am I to offer you not merely to describe Aetna in your poem, and not to\ntouch lightly upon a topic which is a matter of ritual for all poets? Ovid could not be prevented from\nusing this theme simply because Vergil had already fully covered it; nor could either of these writers\nfrighten off Cornelius Severus. Besides, the topic has served them all with happy results, and those\nwho have gone before seem to me not to have forestalled all that could be said, but merely to have\nopened the way.", "It makes a great deal of difference whether you approach a subject that has been exhausted, or one\nwhere the ground has merely been broken; in the latter case, the topic grows day by day, and what\nis already discovered does not hinder new discoveries. Besides, he who writes last has the best of\nthe bargain; he finds already at hand words which, when marshalled in a different way, show a new\nface. And he is not pilfering them, as if they belonged to someone else, when he uses them, for they\nare common property. Now if Aetna does not make your mouth water, I am mistaken in you. You\nhave for some time been desirous of writing something in the grand style and on the level of the\nolder school. For your modesty does not allow you to set your hopes any higher; this quality of yours\nis so pronounced that, it seems to me, you are likely to curb the force of your natural ability, if there\nshould be any danger of outdoing others; so greatly do you reverence the old masters. Wisdom has\nthis advantage, among others, ? that no man can be outdone by another, except during the climb.\nBut when you have arrived at the top, it is a draw; there is no room for further ascent, the game is\nover. Can the sun add to his size? Can the moon advance beyond her usual fulness? The seas do\nnot increase in bulk. The universe keeps the same character, the same limits. Things which have\nreached their full stature cannot grow higher. Men who have attained wisdom will therefore be equal\nand on the same footing. Each of them will possess his own peculiar gifts: one will be more affable,\nanother more facile, another more ready of speech, a fourth more eloquent; but as regards the\nquality under discussion, ? the element that produces happiness, ? it is equal in them all. I do not\nknow whether this Aetna of yours can collapse and fall in ruins, whether this lofty summit, visible for\nmany miles over the deep sea, is wasted by the incessant power of the flames; but I do know that\nvirtue will not be brought down to a lower plane either by flames or by ruins. Hers is the only\ngreatness that knows no lowering; there can be for her no further rising or sinking. Her stature, like\nthat of the stars in the heavens, is fixed. Let us therefore strive to raise ourselves to this altitude.", "It is a vulgar, but still a useful help towards contempt of death, to pass in review those who have\ntenaciously stuck to life. What more then have they gained than those who have died early?\nCertainly they lie in their tombs somewhere at last, Cadicianus, Fabius, Julianus, Lepidus, or any\none else like them, who have carried out many to be buried, and then were carried out themselves.\nAltogether the interval is small between birth and death; and consider with how much trouble, and in\ncompany with what sort of people and in what a feeble body this interval is laboriously passed. Do\nnot then consider life a thing of any value. For look to the immensity of time behind thee, and to the\ntime which is before thee, another boundless space. In this infinity then what is the difference\nbetween him who lives three days and him who lives three generations?", "Already much of the task is accomplished; nay, rather, if I can bring myself to confess the truth, not\nmuch. For goodness does not mean merely being better than the lowest. Who that could catch but a\nmere glimpse of the daylight would boast his powers of vision? One who sees the sun shining\nthrough a mist may be contented meanwhile that he has escaped darkness, but he does not yet\nenjoy the blessing of light. Our souls will not have reason to rejoice in their lot until, freed from this\ndarkness in which they grope, they have not merely glimpsed the brightness with feeble vision, but\nhave absorbed the full light of day and have been restored to their place in the sky, ? until, indeed,\nthey have regained the place which they held at the allotment of their birth. The soul is summoned\nupward by its very origin. And it will reach that goal even before it is released from its prison below,\nas soon as it has cast off sin and, in purity and lightness, has leaped up into celestial realms of\nthought.", "I am glad, beloved Lucilius, that we are occupied with this ideal, that we pursue it with all our might,\neven though few know it, or none. Fame is the shadow of virtue; it will attend virtue even against her\nwill. But, as the shadow sometimes precedes and sometimes follows or even lags behind, so fame\nsometimes goes before us and shows herself in plain sight, and sometimes is in the rear, and is all\nthe greater in proportion as she is late in coming, when once envy has beaten a retreat. How long\ndid men believe Democritus to be mad! Glory barely came to Socrates. And how long did our state\nremain in ignorance of Cato! They rejected him, and did not know his worth until they had lost him. If\nRutilius had not resigned himself to wrong, his innocence and virtue would have escaped notice; the\nhour of his suffering was the hour of his triumph. Did he not give thanks for his lot, and welcome his\nexile with open arms? I have mentioned thus far those to whom Fortune has brought renown at the\nvery moment of persecution; but how many there are whose progress toward virtue has come to\nlight only after their death! And how many have been ruined, not rescued, by their reputation? There\nis Epicurus, for example; mark how greatly he is admired, not only by the more cultured, but also by\nthis ignorant rabble. This man, however, was unknown to Athens itself, near which he had hidden\nhimself away. And so, when he had already survived by many years his friend Metrodorus, he\nadded in a letter these last words, proclaiming with thankful appreciation the friendship that had\nexisted between them: \"So greatly blest were Metrodorus and I that it has been no harm to us to be\nunknown, and almost unheard of, in this well-known land of Greece.\" Is it not true, therefore, that\nmen did not discover him until after he had ceased to be? Has not his renown shone forth, for all\nthat? Metrodorus also admits this fact in one of his letters: that Epicurus and he were not well known\nto the public; but he declares that after the lifetime of Epicurus and himself any man who might wish\nto follow in their footsteps would win great and ready-made renown.", "Virtue is never lost to view; and yet to have been lost to view is no loss. There will come a day which\nwill reveal her, though hidden away or suppressed by the spite of her contemporaries. That man is\nborn merely for a few, who thinks only of the people of his own generation. Many thousands of years\nand many thousands of peoples will come after you; it is to these that you should have regard.\nMalice may have imposed silence upon the mouths of all who were alive in your day; but there will\ncome men who will judge you without prejudice and without favour. If there is any reward that virtue\nreceives at the hands of fame, not even this can pass away. We ourselves, indeed, shall not be\naffected by the talk of posterity; nevertheless, posterity will cherish and celebrate us even though we\nare not conscious thereof. Virtue has never failed to reward a man, both during his life and after his\ndeath, provided he has followed her loyally, provided he has not decked himself out or painted\nhimself up, but has been always the same, whether he appeared before men's eyes after being\nannounced, or suddenly and without preparation. Pretence accomplishes nothing. Few are deceived\nby a mask that is easily drawn over the face. Truth is the same in every part. Things which deceive\nus have no real substance. Lies are thin stuff; they are transparent, if you examine them with care.\nFarewell.", "To-day I have some free time, thanks not so much to myself as to the games, which have attracted\nall the bores to the boxing-match. No one will interrupt me or disturb the train of my thoughts, which\ngo ahead more boldly as the result of my very confidence. My door has not been continually\ncreaking on its hinges nor will my curtain be pulled aside; my thoughts may march safely on, ? and\nthat is all the more necessary for one who goes independently and follows out his own path. Do I\nthen follow no predecessors? Yes, but I allow myself to discover something new, to alter, to reject. I\nam not a slave to them, although I give them my approval.", "And yet that was a very bold word which I spoke when I assured myself that I should have some\nquiet, and some uninterrupted retirement. For lo, a great cheer comes from the stadium, and while it\ndoes not drive me distracted, yet it shifts my thought to a contrast suggested by this very noise. How\nmany men, I say to myself, train their bodies, and how few train their minds! What crowds flock to\nthe games, ? spurious as they are and arranged merely for pastime, ? and what a solitude reigns\nwhere the good arts are taught! How feather-brained are the athletes whose muscles and shoulders\nwe admire! The question which I ponder most of all is this: if the body can be trained to such a\ndegree of endurance that it will stand the blows and kicks of several opponents at once and to such\na degree that a man can last out the day and resist the scorching sun in the midst of the burning\ndust, drenched all the while with his own blood, ? if this can be done, how much more easily might\nthe mind be toughened so that it could receive the blows of Fortune and not be conquered, so that it\nmight struggle to its feet again after it has been laid low, after it has been trampled under foot?", "For although the body needs many things in order to be strong, yet the mind grows from within,\ngiving to itself nourishment and exercise. Yonder athletes must have copious food, copious drink,\ncopious quantities of oil, and long training besides; but you can acquire virtue without equipment\nand without expense. All that goes to make you a good man lies within yourself. And what do you\nneed in order to become good? To wish it. But what better thing could you wish for than to break\naway from this slavery, ? a slavery that oppresses us all, a slavery which even chattels of the lowest\nestate, born amid such degradation, strive in every possible way to strip off? In exchange for\nfreedom they pay out the savings which they have scraped together by cheating their own bellies;\nshall you not be eager to attain liberty at any price, seeing that you claim it as your birthright? Why\ncast glances toward your strong-box? Liberty cannot be bought. It is therefore useless to enter in\nyour ledger the item of \"Freedom,\" for freedom is possessed neither by those who have bought it,\nnor by those who have sold it. You must give this good to yourself, and seek it from yourself.", "First of all, free yourself from the fear of death, for death puts the yoke about our necks; then free\nyourself from the fear of poverty. If you would know how little evil there is in poverty, compare the\nfaces of the poor with those of the rich; the poor man smiles more often and more genuinely; his\ntroubles do not go deep down; even if any anxiety comes upon him, it passes like a fitful cloud. But\nthe merriment of those whom men call happy is feigned, while their sadness is heavy and festering,\nand all the heavier because they may not meanwhile display their grief, but must act the part of\nhappiness in the midst of sorrows that eat out their very hearts. I often feel called upon to use the\nfollowing illustration, and it seems to me that none expresses more effectively this drama of human\nlife, wherein we are assigned the parts which we are to play so badly. Yonder is the man who stalks\nupon the stage with swelling port and head thrown back, and says:", "Whom Pelops left the heir of lands that spread\nFrom Hellespont and from th' Ionian sea\nE'en to the Isthmian straits.", "And who is this fellow? He is but a slave; his wage is five measures of grain and five denarii. Yon\nother who, proud and wayward and puffed up by confidence in his power, declaims:", "Always run to the short way; and the short way is the natural: accordingly say and do everything in\nconformity with the soundest reason. For such a purpose frees a man from trouble, and warfare, and\nall artifice and ostentatious display.", "receives a daily pittance and sleeps on rags. You may speak in the same way about all these\ndandies whom you see riding in litters above the heads of men and above the crowd; in every case\ntheir happiness is put on like the actor's mask. Tear it off, and you will scorn them.", "When you buy a horse, you order its blanket to be removed; you pull off the garments from slaves\nthat are advertised for sale, so that no bodily flaws may escape your notice; if you judge a man, do\nyou judge him when he is wrapped in a disguise? Slave-dealers hide under some sort of finery any\ndefect which may give offence, and for that reason the very trappings arouse the suspicion of the\nbuyer. If you catch sight of a leg or an arm that is bound up in cloths, you demand that it be stripped\nand that the body itself be revealed to you. Do you see yonder Scythian or Sarmatian king, his head\nadorned with the badge of his office? If you wish to see what he amounts to, and to know his full\nworth, take off his diadem; much evil lurks beneath it. But why do I speak of others? If you wish to\nset a value on yourself, put away your money, your estates, your honours, and look into your own\nsoul. At present, you are taking the word of others for what you are. Farewell.", "You complain that you have met with an ungrateful person. If this is your first experience of that sort,\nyou should offer thanks either to your good luck or to your caution. In this case, however, caution\ncan effect nothing but to make you ungenerous. For if you wish to avoid such a danger, you will not\nconfer benefits; and so, that benefits may not be lost with another man, they will be lost to yourself.", "It is better, however, to get no return than to confer no benefits. Even after a poor crop one should\nsow again; for often losses due to continued barrenness of an unproductive soil have been made\ngood by one year's fertility. In order to discover one grateful person, it is worth while to make trial of\nmany ungrateful ones. No man has so unerring a hand when he confers benefits that he is not\nfrequently deceived; it is well for the traveller to wander, that he may again cleave to the path. After\na shipwreck, sailors try the sea again. The banker is not frightened away from the forum by the\nswindler. If one were compelled to drop everything that caused trouble, life would soon grow dull\namid sluggish idleness; but in your case this very condition may prompt you to become more\ncharitable. For when the outcome of any undertaking is unsure, you must try again and again, in\norder to succeed ultimately. I have, however, discussed the matter with sufficient fulness in the\nvolumes which I have written, entitled \"On Benefits.\"", "What I think should rather be investigated is this, ? a question which I feel has not been made\nsufficiently clear: \"Whether he who has helped us has squared the account and has freed us from\nour debt, if he has done us harm later.\" You may add this question also, if you like: \"when the harm\ndone later has been more than the help rendered previously.\" If you are seeking for the formal and\njust decision of a strict judge, you will find that he checks off one act by the other, and declares:\n\"Though the injuries outweigh the benefits, yet we should credit to the benefits anything that stands\nover even after the injury.\" The harm done was indeed greater, but the helpful act was done first.\nHence the time also should be taken into account. Other cases are so clear that I need not remind\nyou that you should also look into such points as: How gladly was the help offered, and how\nreluctantly was the harm done, ? since benefits, as well as injuries, depend on the spirit. \"I did not\nwish to confer the benefit; but I was won over by my respect for the man, or by the importunity of his\nrequest, or by hope.\" Our feeling about every obligation depends in each case upon the spirit in\nwhich the benefit is conferred; we weigh not the bulk of the gift, but the quality of the good-will which\nprompted it. So now let us do away with guess-work; the former deed was a benefit, and the latter,\nwhich transcended the earlier benefit, is an injury. The good man so arranges the two sides of his\nledger that he voluntarily cheats himself by adding to the benefit and subtracting from the injury.", "The more indulgent magistrate, however (and I should rather be such a one), will order us to forget\nthe injury and remember the accommodation. \"But surely,\" you say, \"it is the part of justice to render\nto each that which is his due, ? thanks in return for a benefit, and retribution, or at any rate ill-will, in\nreturn for an injury!\" This, I say, will be true when it is one man who has inflicted the injury, and a\ndifferent man who has conferred the benefit; for if it is the same man, the force of the injury is\nnullified by the benefit conferred. Indeed, a man who ought to be pardoned, even though there were\nno good deeds credited to him in the past, should receive something more than mere leniency if he\ncommits a wrong when he has a benefit to his credit. I do not set an equal value on benefits and\ninjuries. I reckon a benefit at a higher rate than an injury. Not all grateful persons know what it\ninvolves to be in debt for a benefit; even a thoughtless, crude fellow, one of the common herd, may\nknow, especially soon after he has received the gift; but he does not know how deeply he stands in\ndebt therefor. Only the wise man knows exactly what value should be put upon everything; for the\nfool whom I just mentioned, no matter how good his intentions may be, either pays less than he\nowes, or pays it at the wrong time or the wrong place. That for which he should make return he\nwastes and loses. There is a marvellously accurate phraseology applied to certain subjects, a\nlong-established terminology which indicates certain acts by means of symbols that are most\nefficient and that serve to outline men's duties. We are, as you know, wont to speak thus: \"A. has\nmade a return for the favour bestowed by B.\" Making a return means handing over of your own\naccord that which you owe. We do not say, \"He has paid back the favour\"; for \"pay back\" is used of\na man upon whom a demand for payment is made, of those who pay against their will, of those who\npay under any circumstances whatsoever, and of those who pay through a third party. We do not\nsay, \"He has 'restored' the benefit,\" or 'settled' it; we have never been satisfied with a word which\napplies properly to a debt of money. Making a return means offering something to him from whom\nyou have received something. The phrase implies a voluntary return; he who has made such a\nreturn has served the writ upon himself.", "The wise man will inquire in his own mind into all the circumstances: how much he has received,\nfrom whom, when, where, how. And so we declare that none but the wise man knows how to make\nreturn for a favour; moreover, none but the wise man knows how to confer a benefit, ? that man, I\nmean, who enjoys the giving more than the recipient enjoys the receiving. Now some person will\nreckon this remark as one of the generally surprising statements such as we Stoics are wont to\nmake and such as the Greeks call \"paradoxes,\" and will say: \"Do you maintain, then, that only the\nwise man knows how to return a favour? Do you maintain that no one else knows how to make\nrestoration to a creditor for a debt? Or, on buying a commodity, to pay full value to the seller?\" In\norder not to bring any odium upon myself, let me tell you that Epicurus says the same thing. At any\nrate, Metrodorus remarks that only the wise man knows how to return a favour. Again, the objector\nmentioned above wonders at our saying: \"The wise man alone knows how to love, the wise man\nalone is a real friend.\" And yet it is a part of love and of friendship to return favours; nay, further, it is\nan ordinary act, and happens more frequently than real friendship. Again, this same objector\nwonders at our saying, \"There is no loyalty except in the wise man,\" just as if he himself does not\nsay the same thing! Or do you think that there is any loyalty in him who does not know how to return\na favour? These men, accordingly, should cease to discredit us, just as if we were uttering an\nimpossible boast; they should understand that the essence of honour resides in the wise man, while\namong the crowd we find only the ghost and the semblance of honour. None but the wise man\nknows how to return a favour. Even a fool can return it in proportion to his knowledge and his power;\nhis fault would be a lack of knowledge rather than a lack of will or desire. To will does not come by\nteaching.", "The wise man will compare all things with one another; for the very same object becomes greater or\nsmaller, according to the time, the place, and the cause. Often the riches that are spent in profusion\nupon a palace cannot accomplish as much as a thousand denarii given at the right time. Now it\nmakes a great deal of difference whether you give outright, or come to a man's assistance, whether\nyour generosity saves him, or sets him up in life. Often the gift is small, but the consequences great.\nAnd what a distinction do you imagine there is between taking something which one lacks, ?\nsomething which was offered, ? and receiving a benefit in order to confer one in return?", "But we should not slip back into the subject which we have already sufficiently investigated. In this\nbalancing of benefits and injuries, the good man will, to be sure, judge with the highest degree of\nfairness, but he will incline towards the side of the benefit; he will turn more readily in this direction.\nMoreover, in affairs of this kind the person concerned is wont to count for a great deal. Men say:\n\"You conferred a benefit upon me in that matter of the slave, but you did me an injury in the case of\nmy father\" or, \"You saved my son, but robbed me of a father.\" Similarly, he will follow up all other\nmatters in which comparisons can be made, and if the difference be very slight, he will pretend not\nto notice it. Even though the difference be great, yet if the concession can be made without\nimpairment of duty and loyalty, our good man will overlook it ? that is, provided the injury exclusively\naffects the good man himself. To sum up, the matter stands thus: the good man will be easy-going\nin striking a balance; he will allow too much to be set against his credit. He will be unwilling to pay a\nbenefit by balancing the injury against it. The side towards which he will lean, the tendency which he\nwill exhibit, is the desire to be under obligations for the favour, and the desire to make return\ntherefor. For anyone who receives a benefit more gladly than he repays it is mistaken. By as much\nas he who pays is more light-hearted than he who borrows, by so much ought he to be more joyful\nwho unburdens himself of the greatest debt ? a benefit received ? than he who incurs the greatest\nobligations. For ungrateful men make mistakes in this respect also: they have to pay their creditors\nboth capital and interest, but they think that benefits are currency which they can use without\ninterest. So the debts grow through postponement, and the later the action is postponed the more\nremains to be paid. A man is an ingrate if he repays a favour without interest. Therefore, interest\nalso should be allowed for, when you compare your receipts and your expenses. We should try by\nall means to be as grateful as possible.", "For gratitude is a good thing for ourselves, in a sense in which justice, that is commonly supposed to\nconcern other persons, is not; gratitude returns in large measure unto itself. There is not a man who,\nwhen he has benefited his neighbour, has not benefited himself, ? I do not mean for the reason that\nhe whom you have aided will desire to aid you, or that he whom you have defended will desire to\nprotect you, or that an example of good conduct returns in a circle to benefit the doer, just as\nexamples of bad conduct recoil upon their authors, and as men find no pity if they suffer wrongs\nwhich they themselves have demonstrated the possibility of committing; but that the reward for all\nthe virtues lies in the virtues themselves. For they are not practised with a view to recompense; the\nwages of a good deed is to have done it. I am grateful, not in order that my neighbour, provoked by\nthe earlier act of kindness, may be more ready to benefit me, but simply in order that I may perform\na most pleasant and beautiful act; I feel grateful, not because it profits me, but because it pleases\nme. And, to prove the truth of this to you, I declare that even if I may not be grateful without seeming\nungrateful, even if I am able to return a benefit only by an act which resembles an injury; even so, I\nshall strive in the utmost calmness of spirit toward the purpose which honour demands, in the very\nmidst of disgrace. No one, I think, rates virtue higher or is more consecrated to virtue than he who\nhas lost his reputation for being a good man in order to keep from losing the approval of his\nconscience.\nThus, as I have said, your being grateful is more conducive to your own good than to your\nneighbour's good. For while your neighbour has had a common, everyday experience, ? namely,\nreceiving back the gift which he had bestowed, ? you have had a great experience which is the\noutcome of an utterly happy condition of soul, ? to have felt gratitude. For if wickedness makes men\nunhappy and virtue makes men blest, and if it is a virtue to be grateful, then the return which you\nhave made is only the customary thing, but the thing to which you have attained is priceless, ? the\nconsciousness of gratitude, which comes only to the soul that is divine and blessed. The opposite\nfeeling to this, however, is immediately attended by the greatest unhappiness; no man, if he be\nungrateful, will be unhappy in the future. I allow him no day of grace; he is unhappy forthwith.", "In he morning when thou risest unwillingly, let this thought be present- I am rising to the work of a\nhuman being. Why then am I dissatisfied if I am going to do the things for which I exist and for which\nI was brought into the world? Or have I been made for this, to lie in the bed-clothes and keep myself\nwarm?- But this is more pleasant.- Dost thou exist then to take thy pleasure, and not at all for action\nor exertion? Dost thou not see the little plants, the little birds, the ants, the spiders, the bees working\ntogether to put in order their several parts of the universe? And art thou unwilling to do the work of a\nhuman being, and dost thou not make haste to do that which is according to thy nature?- But it is\nnecessary to take rest also.- It is necessary: however nature has fixed bounds to this too: she has\nfixed bounds both to eating and drinking, and yet thou goest beyond these bounds, beyond what is\nsufficient; yet in thy acts it is not so, but thou stoppest short of what thou canst do. So thou lovest\nnot thyself, for if thou didst, thou wouldst love thy nature and her will. But those who love their\nseveral arts exhaust themselves in working at them unwashed and without food; but thou valuest thy\nown own nature less than the turner values the turning art, or the dancer the dancing art, or the\nlover of money values his money, or the vainglorious man his little glory. And such men, when they\nhave a violent affection to a thing, choose neither to eat nor to sleep rather than to perfect the things\nwhich they care for. But are the acts which concern society more vile in thy eyes and less worthy of\nthy labour?", "Let us therefore avoid being ungrateful, not for the sake of others but for our own sakes. When we\ndo wrong, only the least and lightest portion of it flows back upon our neighbour; the worst and, if I\nmay use the term, the densest portion of it stays at home and troubles the owner. My master Attalus\nused to say: \"Evil herself drinks the largest portion of her own poison.\" The poison which serpents\ncarry for the destruction of others, and secrete without harm to themselves, is not like this poison; for\nthis sort is ruinous to the possessor. The ungrateful man tortures and torments himself; he hates the\ngifts which he has accepted, because he must make a return for them, and he tries to belittle their\nvalue, but he really enlarges and exaggerates the injuries which he has received. And what is more\nwretched than a man who forgets his benefits and clings to his injuries?", "Wisdom, on the other hand, lends grace to every benefit, and of her own free will commends it to\nher own favour, and delights her soul by continued recollection thereof. Evil men have but one\npleasure in benefits, and a very short-lived pleasure at that; it lasts only while they are receiving\nthem. But the wise man derives therefrom an abiding and eternal joy. For he takes delight not so\nmuch in receiving the gift as in having received it; and this joy never perishes; it abides with him\nalways. He despises the wrongs done him; he forgets them, not accidentally, but voluntarily. He\ndoes not put a wrong construction upon everything, or seek for someone whom he may hold\nresponsible for each happening; he rather ascribes even the sins of men to chance. He will not\nmisinterpret a word or a look; he makes light of all mishaps by interpreting them in a generous way.\nHe does not remember an injury rather than a service. As far as possible, he lets his memory rest\nupon the earlier and the better deed, never changing his attitude towards those who have deserved\nwell of him, except in cases where the bad deeds far outdistance the good, and the space between\nthem is obvious even to one who closes his eyes to it; even then only to this extent, that he strives,\nafter receiving the preponderant injury, to resume the attitude which he held before he received the\nbenefit. For when the injury merely equals the benefit, a certain amount of kindly feeling is left over.\nJust as a defendant is acquitted when the votes are equal, and just as the spirit of kindliness always\ntries to bend every doubtful case toward the better interpretation, so the mind of the wise man, when\nanother's merits merely equal his bad deeds, will, to be sure, cease to feel an obligation, but does\nnot cease to desire to feel it, and acts precisely like the man who pays his debts even after they\nhave been legally cancelled.", "But no man can be grateful unless he has learned to scorn the things which drive the common herd\nto distraction; if you wish to make return for a favour, you must be willing to go into exile, or to pour\nforth your blood, or to undergo poverty, or ? and this will frequently happen, ? even to let your very\ninnocence be stained and exposed to shameful slanders. It is no slight price that a man must pay for\nbeing grateful. We hold nothing dearer than a benefit, so long as we are seeking one; we hold\nnothing cheaper after we have received it. Do you ask what it is that makes us forget benefits\nreceived? It is our extreme greed for receiving others. We consider not what we have obtained, but\nwhat we are to seek. We are deflected from the right course by riches, titles, power, and everything\nwhich is valuable in our opinion but worthless when rated at its real value. We do not know how to\nweigh matters; we should take counsel regarding them, not with their reputation but with their\nnature; those things possess no grandeur wherewith to enthral our minds, except the fact that we\nhave become accustomed to marvel at them. For they are not praised because they ought to be\ndesired, but they are desired because they have been praised; and when the error of individuals has\nonce created error on the part of the public, then the public error goes on creating error on the part\nof individuals.", "But just as we take on faith such estimates of values, so let us take on the faith of the people this\ntruth, that nothing is more honourable than a grateful heart. This phrase will be echoed by all cities,\nand by all races, even those from savage countries. Upon this point good and bad will agree. Some\npraise pleasure, some prefer toil; some say that pain is the greatest of evils, some say it is no evil at\nall; some will include riches in the Supreme Good, others will say that their discovery meant harm to\nthe human race, and that none is richer than he to whom Fortune has found nothing to give. Amid all\nthis diversity of opinion all men will yet with one voice, as the saying is, vote \"aye\" to the proposition\nthat thanks should be returned to those who have deserved well of us. On this question the common\nherd, rebellious as they are, will all agree, but at present we keep paying back injuries instead of\nbenefits, and the primary reason why a man is ungrateful is that he has found it impossible to be\ngrateful enough. Our madness has gone to such lengths that it is a very dangerous thing to confer\ngreat benefits upon a person; for just because he thinks it shameful not to repay, so he would have\nnone left alive whom he should repay. \"Keep for yourself what you have received; I do not ask it\nback; I do not demand it. Let it be safe to have conferred a favour.\" There is no worse hatred than\nthat which springs from shame at the desecration of a benefit. Farewell.", "I have already ceased to be anxious about you. \"Whom then of the gods,\" you ask, \"have you found\nas your voucher?\" A god, let me tell you, who deceives no one, ? a soul in love with that which is\nupright and good. The better part of yourself is on safe ground. Fortune can inflict injury upon you;\nwhat is more pertinent is that I have no fears lest you do injury to yourself. Proceed as you have\nbegun, and settle yourself in this way of living, not luxuriously, but calmly. I prefer to be in trouble\nrather than in luxury; and you had better interpret the term \"in trouble\" as popular usage is wont to\ninterpret it: living a \"hard,\" \"rough,\" \"toilsome\" life. We are wont to hear the lives of certain men\npraised as follows, when they are objects of unpopularity: \"So-and-So lives luxuriously\"; but by this\nthey mean: \"He is softened by luxury.\" For the soul is made womanish by degrees, and is weakened\nuntil it matches the ease and laziness in which it lies. Lo, is it not better for one who is really a man\neven to become hardened? Next, these same dandies fear that which they have made their own\nlives resemble. Much difference is there between lying idle and lying buried! \"But,\" you say, \"is it not\nbetter even to lie idle than to whirl round in these eddies of business distraction?\" Both extremes are\nto be deprecated ? both tension and sluggishness. I hold that he who lies on a perfumed couch is no\nless dead than he who is dragged along by the executioner's hook.", "Leisure without study is death; it is a tomb for the living man. What then is the advantage of\nretirement? As if the real causes of our anxieties did not follow us across the seas! What\nhiding-place is there, where the fear of death does not enter? What peaceful haunts are there, so\nfortified and so far withdrawn that pain does not fill them with fear? Wherever you hide yourself,\nhuman ills will make an uproar all around. There are many external things which compass us about,\nto deceive us or to weigh upon us; there are many things within which, even amid solitude, fret and\nferment.", "Therefore, gird yourself about with philosophy, an impregnable wall. Though it be assaulted by many\nengines, Fortune can find no passage into it. The soul stands on unassailable ground, if it has\nabandoned external things; it is independent in its own fortress; and every weapon that is hurled\nfalls short of the mark. Fortune has not the long reach with which we credit her; she can seize none\nexcept him that clings to her. Let us then recoil from her as far as we are able. This will be possible\nfor us only through knowledge of self and of the world of Nature. The soul should know whither it is\ngoing and whence it came, what is good for it and what is evil, what it seeks and what it avoids, and\nwhat is that Reason which distinguishes between the desirable and the undesirable, and thereby\ntames the madness of our desires and calms the violence of our fears.", "Some men flatter themselves that they have checked these evils by themselves even without the aid\nof philosophy; but when some accident catches them off their guard, a tardy confession of error is\nwrung from them. Their boastful words perish from their lips when the torturer commands them to\nstretch forth their hands, and when death draws nearer! You might say to such a man: \"It was easy\nfor you to challenge evils that were not near-by; but here comes pain, which you declared you could\nendure; here comes death, against which you uttered many a courageous boast! The whip cracks,\nthe sword flashes:", "This strength of heart, however, will come from constant study, provided that you practise, not with\nthe tongue but with the soul, and provided that you prepare yourself to meet death. To enable\nyourself to meet death, you may expect no encouragement or cheer from those who try to make you\nbelieve, by means of their hair-splitting logic, that death is no evil. For I take pleasure, excellent\nLucilius, in poking fun at the absurdities of the Greeks, of which, to my continual surprise, I have not\nyet succeeded in ridding myself. Our master Zeno uses a syllogism like this: \"No evil is glorious; but\ndeath is glorious; therefore death is no evil.\" A cure, Zeno! I have been freed from fear; henceforth I\nshall not hesitate to bare my neck on the scaffold. Will you not utter sterner words instead of rousing\na dying man to laughter? Indeed, Lucilius, I could not easily tell you whether he who thought that he\nwas quenching the fear of death by setting up this syllogism was the more foolish, or he who\nattempted to refute it, just as if it had anything to do with the matter! For the refuter himself proposed\na counter-syllogism, based upon the proposition that we regard death as \"indifferent,\" ? one of the\nthings which the Greeks call ????????. \"Nothing,\" he says, \"that is indifferent can be glorious; death\nis glorious; therefore death is not indifferent.\" You comprehend the tricky fallacy which is contained\nin this syllogism: mere death is, in fact, not glorious; but a brave death is glorious. And when you\nsay: \"Nothing that is indifferent is glorious,\" I grant you this much, and declare that nothing is\nglorious except as it deals with indifferent things. I classify as \"indifferent,\" ? that is, neither good nor\nevil ? sickness, pain, poverty, exile, death. None of these things is intrinsically glorious; but nothing\ncan be glorious apart from them. For it is not poverty that we praise, it is the man whom poverty\ncannot humble or bend. Nor is it exile that we praise, it is the man who withdraws into exile in the\nspirit in which he would have sent another into exile. It is not pain that we praise, it is the man whom\npain has not coerced. One praises not death, but the man whose soul death takes away before it\ncan confound it. All these things are in themselves neither honourable nor glorious; but any one of\nthem that virtue has visited and touched is made honourable and glorious by virtue; they merely lie\nin between, and the decisive question is only whether wickedness or virtue has laid hold upon them.\nFor instance, the death which in Cato's case is glorious, is in the case of Brutus forthwith base and", "disgraceful. For this Brutus, condemned to death, was trying to obtain postponement; he withdrew a\nmoment in order to ease himself; when summoned to die and ordered to bare his throat, he\nexclaimed: \"I will bare my throat, if only I may live!\" What madness it is to run away, when it is\nimpossible to turn back! \"I will bare my throat, if only I may live!\" He came very near saying also:\n\"even under Antony!\" This fellow deserved indeed to be consigned to life!", "But, as I was going on to remark, you see that death in itself is neither an evil nor a good; Cato\nexperienced death most honourably, Brutus most basely. Everything, if you add virtue, assumes a\nglory which it did not possess before. We speak of a sunny room, even though the same room is\npitch-dark at night. It is the day which fills it with light, and the night which steals the light away; thus\nit is with the things which we call indifferent and \"middle,\" like riches, strength, beauty, titles,\nkingship, and their opposites, ? death, exile, ill-health, pain, and all such evils, the fear of which\nupsets us to a greater or less extent; it is the wickedness or the virtue that bestows the name of\ngood or evil. An object is not by its own essence either hot or cold; it is heated when thrown into a\nfurnace, and chilled when dropped into water. Death is honourable when related to that which is\nhonourable; by this I mean virtue and a soul that despises the worst hardships.", "How easy it is to repel and to wipe away every impression which is troublesome or unsuitable, and\nimmediately to be in all tranquility.", "Furthermore, there are vast distinctions among these qualities which we call \"middle.\" For example,\ndeath is not so indifferent as the question whether your hair should be worn evenly or unevenly.\nDeath belongs among those things which are not indeed evils, but still have in them a semblance of\nevil; for there are implanted in us love of self, a desire for existence and self-preservation, and also\nan abhorrence of dissolution, because death seems to rob us of many goods and to withdraw us\nfrom the abundance to which we have become accustomed. And there is another element which\nestranges us from death: we are already familiar with the present, but are ignorant of the future into\nwhich we shall transfer ourselves, and we shrink from the unknown. Moreover, it is natural to fear\nthe world of shades, whither death is supposed to lead. Therefore, although death is something\nindifferent, it is nevertheless not a thing which we can easily ignore. The soul must be hardened by\nlong practice, so that it may learn to endure the sight and the approach of death.", "Death ought to be despised more than it is wont to be despised. For we believe too many of the\nstories about death. Many thinkers have striven hard to increase its ill repute; they have portrayed\nthe prison in the world below and the land overwhelmed by everlasting night, where", "Doth sprawl his ugly length on half-crunched bones,\nAnd terrifies the disembodied ghosts\nWith never-ceasing bark.", "Even if you can win your point and prove that these are mere stories and that nothing is left for the\ndead to fear, another fear steals upon you. For the fear of going to the underworld is equalled by the\nfear of going nowhere.", "In the face of these notions, which long-standing opinion has dinned in our ears, how can brave\nendurance of death be anything else than glorious, and fit to rank among the greatest\naccomplishments of the human mind? For the mind will never rise to virtue if it believes that death is\nan evil; but it will so rise if it holds that death is a matter of indifference. It is not in the order of nature\nthat a man shall proceed with a great heart to a destiny which he believes to be evil; he will go\nsluggishly and with reluctance. But nothing glorious can result from unwillingness and cowardice;\nvirtue does nothing under compulsion. Besides, no deed that a man does is honourable unless he\nhas devoted himself thereto and attended to it with all his heart, rebelling against it with no portion of\nhis being. When, however, a man goes to face an evil, either through fear of worse evils or in the\nhope of goods whose attainment is of sufficient moment to him that he can swallow the one evil\nwhich he must endure, ? in that case the judgment of the agent is drawn in two directions. On the\none side is the motive which bids him carry out his purpose; on the other, the motive which restrains\nhim and makes him flee from something which has aroused his apprehension or leads to danger.\nHence he is torn in different directions; and if this happens, the glory of his act is gone. For virtue\naccomplishes its plans only when the spirit is in harmony with itself. There is no element of fear in\nany of its actions.", "You cannot \"still braver go,\" if you are persuaded that those things are the real evils. Root out this\nidea from your soul; otherwise your apprehensions will remain undecided and will thus check the\nimpulse to action. You will be pushed into that towards which you ought to advance like a soldier.", "Those of our school, it is true, would have men think that Zeno's syllogism is correct, but that the\nsecond I mentioned, which is set up against his, is deceptive and wrong. But I for my part decline to\nreduce such questions to a matter of dialectical rules or to the subtleties of an utterly worn-out\nsystem. Away, I say, with all that sort of thing, which makes a man feel, when a question is\npropounded to him, that he is hemmed in, and forces him to admit a premiss, and then makes him\nsay one thing in his answer when his real opinion is another. When truth is at stake, we must act\nmore frankly; and when fear is to be combated, we must act more bravely. Such questions, which\nthe dialecticians involve in subtleties, I prefer to solve and weigh rationally, with the purpose of\nwinning conviction and not of forcing the judgment.", "When a general is about to lead into action an army prepared to meet death for their wives and\nchildren, how will he exhort them to battle? I remind you of the Fabii, who took upon a single clan a\nwar which concerned the whole state. I point out to you the Lacedaemonians in position at the very\npass of Thermopylae! They have no hope of victory, no hope of returning. The place where they\nstand is to be their tomb. In what language do you encourage them to bar the way with their bodies\nand take upon themselves the ruin of their whole tribe, and to retreat from life rather than from their\npost? Shall you say: \"That which is evil is not glorious; but death is glorious; therefore death is not\nan evil\"? What a powerful discourse! After such words, who would hesitate to throw himself upon the\nserried spears of the foemen, and die in his tracks? But take Leonidas: how bravely did he address\nhis men! He said: \"Fellow-soldiers, let us to our breakfast, knowing that we shall sup in Hades!\" The\nfood of these men did not grow lumpy in their mouths, or stick in their throats, or slip from their\nfingers; eagerly did they accept the invitation to breakfast, and to supper also! Think, too, of the\nfamous Roman general; his soldiers had been dispatched to seize a position, and when they were\nabout to make their way through a huge army of the enemy, he addressed them with the words:\n\"You must go now, fellow-soldiers, to yonder place, whence there is no 'must' about your returning!\"", "Judge every word and deed which are according to nature to be fit for thee; and be not diverted by\nthe blame which follows from any people nor by their words, but if a thing is good to be done or said,\ndo not consider it unworthy of thee. For those persons have their peculiar leading principle and\nfollow their peculiar movement; which things do not thou regard, but go straight on, following thy\nown nature and the common nature; and the way of both is one.", "You see, then, how straightforward and peremptory virtue is; but what man on earth can your\ndeceptive logic make more courageous or more upright? Rather does it break the spirit, which\nshould never be less straitened or forced to deal with petty and thorny problems than when some\ngreat work is being planned. It is not the Three Hundred, ? it is all mankind that should be relieved of\nthe fear of death. But how can you prove to all those men that death is no evil? How can you\novercome the notions of all our past life, ? notions with which we are tinged from our very infancy?\nWhat succour can you discover for man's helplessness? What can you say that will make men rush,\nburning with zeal, into the midst of danger? By what persuasive speech can you turn aside this\nuniversal feeling of fear, by what strength of wit can you turn aside the conviction of the human race\nwhich steadfastly opposes you? Do you propose to construct catchwords for me, or to string\ntogether petty syllogisms? It takes great weapons to strike down great monsters. You recall the\nfierce serpent in Africa, more frightful to the Roman legions than the war itself, and assailed in vain\nby arrows and slings; it could not be wounded even by \"Pythius,\" since its huge size, and the\ntoughness which matched its bulk, made spears, or any weapon hurled by the hand of man, glance\noff. It was finally destroyed by rocks equal in size to millstones. Are you, then, hurling petty weapons\nlike yours even against death? Can you stop a lion's charge by an awl? Your arguments are indeed\nsharp; but there is nothing sharper than a stalk of grain. And certain arguments are rendered\nuseless and unavailing by their very subtlety. Farewell.", "You bid me give you an account of each separate day, and of the whole day too; so you must have\na good opinion of me if you think that in these days of mine there is nothing to hide. At any rate, it is\nthus that we should live, ? as if we lived in plain sight of all men; and it is thus that we should think, ?\nas if there were someone who could look into our inmost souls; and there is one who can so look.\nFor what avails it that something is hidden from man? Nothing is shut off from the sight of God. He is\nwitness of our souls, and he comes into the very midst of our thoughts ? comes into them, I say, as\none who may at any time depart. I shall therefore do as you bid, and shall gladly inform you by letter\nwhat I am doing, and in what sequence. I shall keep watching myself continually, and ? a most\nuseful habit ? shall review each day. For this is what makes us wicked: that no one of us looks back\nover his own life. Our thoughts are devoted only to what we are about to do. And yet our plans for\nthe future always depend on the past.", "To-day has been unbroken; no one has filched the slightest part of it from me. The whole time has\nbeen divided between rest and reading. A brief space has been given over to bodily exercise, and\non this ground I can thank old age ? my exercise costs very little effort; as soon as I stir, I am tired.\nAnd weariness is the aim and end of exercise, no matter how strong one is. Do you ask who are my\npacemakers? One is enough for me, ? the slave Pharius, a pleasant fellow, as you know; but I shall\nexchange him for another. At my time of life I need one who is of still more tender years. Pharius, at\nany rate, says that he and I are at the same period of life; for we are both losing our teeth. Yet even\nnow I can scarcely follow his pace as he runs, and within a very short time I shall not be able to\nfollow him at all; so you see what profit we get from daily exercise. Very soon does a wide interval\nopen between two persons who travel different ways. My slave is climbing up at the very moment\nwhen I am coming down, and you surely know how much quicker the latter is. Nay, I was wrong; for\nnow my life is not coming down; it is falling outright. Do you ask, for all that, how our race resulted\nto-day? We raced to a tie, ? something which rarely happens in a running contest. After tiring myself\nout in this way (for I cannot call it exercise), I took a cold bath; this, at my house, means just short of\nhot. I, the former cold-water enthusiast, who used to celebrate the new year by taking a plunge into\nthe canal, who, just as naturally as I would set out to do some reading or writing, or to compose a\nspeech, used to inaugurate the first of the year with a plunge into the Virgo aqueduct, have changed\nmy allegiance, first to the Tiber, and then to my favourite tank, which is warmed only by the sun, at\ntimes when I am most robust and when there is not a flaw in my bodily processes. I have very little\nenergy left for bathing. After the bath, some stale bread and breakfast without a table; no need to\nwash the hands after such a meal. Then comes a very short nap. You know my habit; I avail myself\nof a scanty bit of sleep, ? unharnessing, as it were. For I am satisfied if I can just stop staying\nawake. Sometimes I know that I have slept; at other times, I have a mere suspicion.", "Lo, now the din of the Races sounds about me! My ears are smitten with sudden and general\ncheering. But this does not upset my thoughts or even break their continuity. I can endure an uproar\nwith complete resignation.

I will tell you. A thought sticks in\nmy mind, left over from yesterday, ? namely, what men of the greatest sagacity have meant when\nthey have offered the most trifling and intricate proofs for problems of the greatest importance, ?\nproofs which may be true, but none the less resemble fallacies. Zeno, that greatest of men, the\nrevered founder of our brave and holy school of philosophy, wishes to discourage us from\ndrunkenness. Listen, then, to his arguments proving that the good man will not get drunk: \"No one\nentrusts a secret to a drunken man; but one will entrust a secret to a good man; therefore, the good\nman will not get drunk.\" Mark how ridiculous Zeno is made when we set up a similar syllogism in\ncontrast with his. There are many, but one will be enough: \"No one entrusts a secret to a man when\nhe is asleep; but one entrusts a secret to a good man; therefore, the good man does not go to\nsleep.\" Posidonius pleads the cause of our master Zeno in the only possible way; but it cannot, I\nhold, be pleaded even in this way. For Posidonius maintains that the word \"drunken\" is used in two\nways, ? in the one case of a man who is loaded with wine and has no control over himself; in the\nother, of a man who is accustomed to get drunk, and is a slave to the habit. Zeno, he says, meant\nthe latter, ? the man who is accustomed to get drunk, not the man who is drunk; and no one would\nentrust to this person any secret, for it might be blabbed out when the man was in his cups. This is a\nfallacy. For the first syllogism refers to him who is actually drunk and not to him who is about to get\ndrunk. You will surely admit that there is a great difference between a man who is drunk and a\ndrunkard. He who is actually drunk may be in this state for the first time and may not have the habit,\nwhile the drunkard is often free from drunkenness. I therefore interpret the word in its usual\nmeaning, especially since the syllogism is set up by a man who makes a business of the careful use\nof words, and who weighs his language. Moreover, if this is what Zeno meant, and what he wished it\nto mean to us, he was trying to avail himself of an equivocal word in order to work in a fallacy; and\nno man ought to do this when truth is the object of inquiry.", "But let us admit, indeed, that he meant what Posidonius says; even so, the conclusion is false, ?\nthat secrets are not entrusted to an habitual drunkard. Think how many soldiers who are not always\nsober have been entrusted by a general or a captain or a centurion with messages which might not\nbe divulged! With regard to the notorious plot to murder Gaius Caesar, ? I mean the Caesar who\nconquered Pompey and got control of the state, ? Tillius Cimber was trusted with it no less than\nGaius Cassius. Now Cassius throughout his life drank water; while Tillius Cimber was a sot as well\nas a brawler. Cimber himself alluded to this fact, saying: \"I carry a master? I cannot carry my liquor!\"\nSo let each one call to mind those who, to his knowledge, can be ill trusted with wine, but well\ntrusted with the spoken word; and yet one case occurs to my mind, which I shall relate, lest it fall into\noblivion. For life should be provided with conspicuous illustrations. Let us not always be harking\nback to the dim past.", "Lucius Piso, the Director of Public Safety at Rome, was drunk from the very time of his appointment.\nHe used to spend the greater part of the night at banquets, and would sleep until noon. That was the\nway he spent his morning hours. Nevertheless, he applied himself most diligently to his official\nduties, which included the guardianship of the city. Even the sainted Augustus trusted him with\nsecret orders when he placed him in command of Thrace. Piso conquered that country. Tiberius,\ntoo, trusted him when he took his holiday in Campania, leaving behind him in the city many a critical\nmatter that aroused both suspicion and hatred. I fancy that it was because Piso's drunkenness\nturned out well for the Emperor that he appointed to the office of city prefect Cossus, a man of\nauthority and balance, but so soaked and steeped in drink that once, at a meeting of the Senate,\nwhither he had come after banqueting, he was overcome by a slumber from which he could not be\nroused, and had to be carried home. It was to this man that Tiberius sent many orders, written in his\nown hand, ? orders which he believed he ought not to trust even to the officials of his household.\nCossus never let a single secret slip out, whether personal or public.", "So let us abolish all such harangues as this: \"No man in the bonds of drunkenness has power over\nhis soul. As the very vats are burst by new wine, and as the dregs at the bottom are raised to the\nsurface by the strength of the fermentation; so, when the wine effervesces, whatever lies hidden\nbelow is brought up and made visible. As a man overcome by liquor cannot keep down his food\nwhen he has over-indulged in wine, so he cannot keep back a secret either. He pours forth\nimpartially both his own secrets and those of other persons.\" This, of course, is what commonly\nhappens, but so does this, ? that we take counsel on serious subjects with those whom we know to\nbe in the habit of drinking freely. Therefore this proposition, which is laid down in the guise of a\ndefence of Zeno's syllogism, is false, ? that secrets are not entrusted to the habitual drunkard.", "How much better it is to arraign drunkenness frankly and to expose its vices! For even the middling\ngood man avoids them, not to mention the perfect sage, who is satisfied with slaking his thirst; the\nsage, even if now and then he is led on by good cheer which, for a friend's sake, is carried\nsomewhat too far, yet always stops short of drunkenness. We shall investigate later the question\nwhether the mind of the sage is upset by too much wine and commits follies like those of the toper;\nbut meanwhile, if you wish to prove that a good man ought not to get drunk, why work it out by\nlogic? Show how base it is to pour down more liquor than one can carry, and not to know the\ncapacity of one's own stomach; show how often the drunkard does things which make him blush\nwhen he is sober; state that drunkenness is nothing but a condition of insanity purposely assumed.\nProlong the drunkard's condition to several days; will you have any doubt about his madness? Even\nas it is, the madness is no less; it merely lasts a shorter time. Think of Alexander of Macedon, who\nstabbed Clitus, his dearest and most loyal friend, at a banquet; after Alexander understood what he\nhad done, he wished to die, and assuredly he ought to have died.", "Drunkenness kindles and discloses every kind of vice, and removes the sense of shame that veils\nour evil undertakings. For more men abstain from forbidden actions because they are ashamed of\nsinning than because their inclinations are good. When the strength of wine has become too great\nand has gained control over the mind, every lurking evil comes forth from its hiding-place.\nDrunkenness does not create vice, it merely brings it into view; at such times the lustful man does\nnot wait even for the privacy of a bedroom, but without postponement gives free play to the\ndemands of his passions; at such times the unchaste man proclaims and publishes his malady; at\nsuch times your cross-grained fellow does not restrain his tongue or his hand. The haughty man\nincreases his arrogance, the ruthless man his cruelty, the slanderer his spitefulness. Every vice is\ngiven free play and comes to the front. Besides, we forget who we are, we utter words that are\nhalting and poorly enunciated, the glance is unsteady, the step falters, the head is dizzy, the very\nceiling moves about as if a cyclone were whirling the whole house, and the stomach suffers torture\nwhen the wine generates gas and causes our very bowels to swell.\nHowever, at the time, these troubles can be endured, so long as the man retains his natural\nstrength; but what can he do when sleep impairs his powers, and when that which was drunkenness\nbecomes indigestion?", "I go through the things which happen according to nature until I shall fall and rest, breathing out my\nbreath into that element out of which I daily draw it in, and falling upon that earth out of which my\nfather collected the seed, and my mother the blood, and my nurse the milk; out of which during so\nmany years I have been supplied with food and drink; which bears me when I tread on it and abuse\nit for so many purposes.", "Think of the calamities caused by drunkenness in a nation! This evil has betrayed to their enemies\nthe most spirited and warlike races; this evil has made breaches in walls defended by the stubborn\nwarfare of many years; this evil has forced under alien sway peoples who were utterly unyielding\nand defiant of the yoke; this evil has conquered by the wine-cup those who in the field were\ninvincible. Alexander, whom I have just mentioned, passed through his many marches, his many\nbattles, his many winter campaigns (through which he worked his way by overcoming disadvantages\nof time or place), the many rivers which flowed from unknown sources, and the many seas, all in\nsafety; it was intemperance in drinking that laid him low, and the famous death-dealing bowl of\nHercules.", "What glory is there in carrying much liquor? When you have won the prize, and the other\nbanqueters, sprawling asleep or vomiting, have declined your challenge to still other toasts; when\nyou are the last survivor of the revels; when you have vanquished every one by your magnificent\nshow of prowess and there is no man who has proved himself of so great capacity as you, ? you are\nvanquished by the cask. Mark Antony was a great man, a man of distinguished ability; but what\nruined him and drove him into foreign habits and un-Roman vices, if it was not drunkenness and ?\nno less potent than wine ? love of Cleopatra? This it was that made him an enemy of the state; this\nit was that rendered him no match for his enemies; this it was that made him cruel, when as he sat\nat table the heads of the leaders of the state were brought in; when amid the most elaborate feasts\nand royal luxury he would identify the faces and hands of men whom he had proscribed; when,\nthough heavy with wine, he yet thirsted for blood. It was intolerable that he was getting drunk while\nhe did such things; how much more intolerable that he did these things while actually drunk! Cruelty\nusually follows wine-bibbing; for a man's soundness of mind is corrupted and made savage. Just as\na lingering illness makes men querulous and irritable and drives them wild at the least crossing of\ntheir desires, so continued bouts of drunkenness bestialize the soul. For when people are often\nbeside themselves, the habit of madness lasts on, and the vices which liquor generated retain their\npower even when the liquor is gone.", "Therefore you should state why the wise man ought not to get drunk. Explain by facts, and not by\nmere words, the hideousness of the thing, and its haunting evils. Do that which is easiest of all ?\nnamely, demonstrate that what men call pleasures are punishments as soon as they have exceeded\ndue bounds. For if you try to prove that the wise man can souse himself with much wine and yet\nkeep his course straight, even though he be in his cups, you may go on to infer by syllogisms that\nhe will not die if he swallows poison, that he will not sleep if he takes a sleeping-potion, that he will\nnot vomit and reject the matter which clogs his stomach when you give him hellebore. But, when a\nman's feet totter and his tongue is unsteady, what reason have you for believing that he is half sober\nand half drunk? Farewell.", "The journeys to which you refer ? journeys that shake the laziness out of my system ? I hold to be\nprofitable both for my health and for my studies. You see why they benefit my health: since my\npassion for literature makes me lazy and careless about my body, I can take exercise by deputy; as\nfor my studies, I shall show you why my journeys help them, for I have not stopped my reading in\nthe slightest degree. And reading, I hold, is indispensable ? primarily, to keep me from being\nsatisfied with myself alone, and besides, after I have learned what others have found out by their\nstudies, to enable me to pass judgment on their discoveries and reflect upon discoveries that remain\nto be made. Reading nourishes the mind and refreshes it when it is wearied with study;\nnevertheless, this refreshment is not obtained without study. We ought not to confine ourselves\neither to writing or to reading; the one, continuous writing, will cast a gloom over our strength, and\nexhaust it; the other will make our strength flabby and watery. It is better to have recourse to them\nalternately, and to blend one with the other, so that the fruits of one's reading may be reduced to\nconcrete form by the pen.", "We should follow, men say, the example of the bees, who flit about and cull the flowers that are\nsuitable for producing honey, and then arrange and assort in their cells all that they have brought in;\nthese bees, as our Vergil says,", "It is not certain whether the juice which they obtain from the flowers forms at once into honey, or\nwhether they change that which they have gathered into this delicious object by blending something\ntherewith and by a certain property of their breath. For some authorities believe that bees do not\npossess the art of making honey, but only of gathering it; and they say that in India honey has been\nfound on the leaves of certain reeds, produced by a dew peculiar to that climate, or by the juice of\nthe reed itself, which has an unusual sweetness, and richness. And in our own grasses too, they\nsay, the same quality exists, although less clear and less evident; and a creature born to fulfil such a\nfunction could hunt it out and collect it. Certain others maintain that the materials which the bees\nhave culled from the most delicate of blooming and flowering plants is transformed into this peculiar\nsubstance by a process of preserving and careful storing away, aided by what might be called\nfermentation, ? whereby separate elements are united into one substance.", "But I must not be led astray into another subject than that which we are discussing. We also, I say,\nought to copy these bees, and sift whatever we have gathered from a varied course of reading, for\nsuch things are better preserved if they are kept separate; then, by applying the supervising care\nwith which our nature has endowed us, ? in other words, our natural gifts, ? we should so blend\nthose several flavours into one delicious compound that, even though it betrays its origin, yet it\nnevertheless is clearly a different thing from that whence it came. This is what we see nature doing\nin our own bodies without any labour on our part; the food we have eaten, as long as it retains its\noriginal quality and floats in our stomachs as an undiluted mass, is a burden; but it passes into\ntissue and blood only when it has been changed from its original form. So it is with the food which\nnourishes our higher nature, ? we should see to it that whatever we have absorbed should not be\nallowed to remain unchanged, or it will be no part of us. We must digest it; otherwise it will merely\nenter the memory and not the reasoning power. Let us loyally welcome such foods and make them\nour own, so that something that is one may be formed out of many elements, just as one number is\nformed of several elements whenever, by our reckoning, lesser sums, each different from the others,\nare brought together. This is what our mind should do: it should hide away all the materials by which\nit has been aided, and bring to light only what it has made of them. Even if there shall appear in you\na likeness to him who, by reason of your admiration, has left a deep impress upon you, I would have\nyou resemble him as a child resembles his father, and not as a picture resembles its original; for a\npicture is a lifeless thing.", "\"What,\" you say, \"will it not be seen whose style you are imitating, whose method of reasoning,\nwhose pungent sayings?\" I think that sometimes it is impossible for it to be seen who is being\nimitated, if the copy is a true one; for a true copy stamps its own form upon all the features which it\nhas drawn from what we may call the original, in such a way that they are combined into a unity. Do\nyou not see how many voices there are in a chorus? Yet out of the many only one voice results. In\nthat chorus one voice takes the tenor, another the bass, another the baritone. There are women,\ntoo, as well as men, and the flute is mingled with them. In that chorus the voices of the individual\nsingers are hidden; what we hear is the voices of all together. To be sure, I am referring to the\nchorus which the old-time philosophers knew; in our present-day exhibitions we have a larger\nnumber of singers than there used to be spectators in the theatres of old. All the aisles are filled with\nrows of singers; brass instruments surround the auditorium; the stage resounds with flutes and\ninstruments of every description; and yet from the discordant sounds a harmony is produced.", "I would have my mind of such a quality as this; it should be equipped with many arts, many\nprecepts, and patterns of conduct taken from many epochs of history; but all should blend\nharmoniously into one. \"How,\" you ask, \"can this be accomplished?\" By constant effort, and by\ndoing nothing without the approval of reason.

Instead of this, direct your course hither to wisdom, and seek\nher ways, which are ways of surpassing peace and plenty. Whatever seems conspicuous in the\naffairs of men ? however petty it may really be and prominent only by contrast with the lowest\nobjects ? is nevertheless approached by a difficult and toilsome pathway. It is a rough road that\nleads to the heights of greatness; but if you desire to scale this peak, which lies far above the range\nof Fortune, you will indeed look down from above upon all that men regard as most lofty, but none\nthe less you can proceed to the top over level ground.

Only if in truth thou canst be charged with\nbeing rather slow and dull of comprehension, thou must exert thyself about this also, not neglecting\nit nor yet taking pleasure in thy dulness.", "I had been inclined to spare you, and had omitted any knotty problems that still remained\nundiscussed; I was satisfied to give you a sort of taste of the views held by the men of our school,\nwho desire to prove that virtue is of itself sufficiently capable of rounding out the happy life. But now\nyou bid me include the entire bulk either of our own syllogisms or of those which have been devised\nby other schools for the purpose of belittling us. If I shall be willing to do this, the result will be a\nbook, instead of a letter. And I declare again and again that I take no pleasure in such proofs. I am\nashamed to enter the arena and undertake battle on behalf of gods and men armed only with an\nawl.", "\"He that possesses prudence is also self-restrained; he that possesses self-restraint is also\nunwavering; he that is unwavering is unperturbed; he that is unperturbed is free from sadness; he\nthat is free from sadness is happy. Therefore, the prudent man is happy, and prudence is sufficient\nto constitute the happy life.\"", "Certain of the Peripatetics reply to this syllogism by interpreting \"unperturbed,\" \"unwavering,\" and\n\"free from sadness\" in such a way as to make \"unperturbed\" mean one who is rarely perturbed and\nonly to a moderate degree, and not one who is never perturbed. Likewise, they say that a person is\ncalled \"free from sadness\" who is not subject to sadness, one who falls into this objectionable state\nnot often nor in too great a degree. It is not, they say, the way of human nature that a man's spirit\nshould be exempt from sadness, or that the wise man is not overcome by grief but is merely touched\nby it, and other arguments of this sort, all in accordance with the teachings of their school. They do\nnot abolish the passions in this way; they only moderate them. But how petty is the superiority which\nwe attribute to the wise man, if he is merely braver than the most craven, happier than the most\ndejected, more self-controlled than the most unbridled, and greater than the lowliest! Would Ladas\nboast his swiftness in running by comparing himself with the halt and the weak?", "And touch them not, nor bruise the tender ears;\nOr travel over seas, well-poised above\nThe swollen floods, nor dip her flying feet\nIn ocean's waters.", "This is speed estimated by its own standard, not the kind which wins praise by comparison with that\nwhich is slowest. Would you call a man well who has a light case of fever? No, for good health does\nnot mean moderate illness. They say, \"The wise man is called unperturbed in the sense in which\npomegranates are called mellow ? not that there is no hardness at all in their seeds, but that the\nhardness is less than it was before.\" That view is wrong; for I am not referring to the gradual\nweeding out of evils in a good man, but to the complete absence of evils; there should be in him no\nevils at all, not even any small ones. For if there are any, they will grow, and as they grow will\nhamper him. Just as a large and complete cataract wholly blinds the eyes, so a medium-sized\ncataract dulls their vision.", "If by your definition the wise man has any passions whatever, his reason will be no match for them\nand will be carried swiftly along, as it were, on a rushing stream, ? particularly if you assign to him,\nnot one passion with which he must wrestle, but all the passions. And a throng of such, even though\nthey be moderate, can affect him more than the violence of one powerful passion. He has a craving\nfor money, although in a moderate degree. He has ambition, but it is not yet fully aroused. He has a\nhot temper, but it can be appeased. He has inconstancy, but not the kind that is very capricious or\neasily set in motion. He has lust, but not the violent kind. We could deal better with a person who\npossessed one full-fledged vice, than with one who possessed all the vices, but none of them in\nextreme form. Again, it makes no difference how great the passion is; no matter what its size may\nbe, it knows no obedience, and does not welcome advice. Just as no animal, whether wild or tamed\nand gentle, obeys reason, since nature made it deaf to advice; so the passions do not follow or\nlisten, however slight they are. Tigers and lions never put off their wildness; they sometimes\nmoderate it, and then, when you are least prepared, their softened fierceness is roused to madness.\nVices are never genuinely tamed. Again, if reason prevails, the passions will not even get a start;\nbut if they get under way against the will of reason, they will maintain themselves against the will of\nreason. For it is easier to stop them in the beginning than to control them when they gather force.\nThis half-way ground is accordingly misleading and useless; it is to be regarded just as the\ndeclaration that we ought to be \"moderately\" insane, or \"moderately\" ill. Virtue alone possesses\nmoderation; the evils that afflict the mind do not admit of moderation. You can more easily remove\nthan control them. Can one doubt that the vices of the human mind, when they have become\nchronic and callous (\"diseases\" we call them), are beyond control, as, for example, greed, cruelty,\nand wantonness? Therefore the passions also are beyond control; for it is from the passions that we\npass over to the vices. Again, if you grant any privileges to sadness, fear, desire, and all the other\nwrong impulses, they will cease to lie within our jurisdiction. And why? Simply because the means of\narousing them lie outside our own power. They will accordingly increase in proportion as the causes\nby which they are stirred up are greater or less. Fear will grow to greater proportions, if that which", "causes the terror is seen to be of greater magnitude or in closer proximity; and desire will grow\nkeener in proportion as the hope of a greater gain has summoned it to action. If the existence of the\npassions is not in our own control, neither is the extent of their power; for if you once permit them to\nget a start, they will increase along with their causes, and they will be of whatever extent they shall\ngrow to be. Moreover, no matter how small these vices are, they grow greater. That which is harmful\nnever keeps within bounds. No matter how trifling diseases are at the beginning, they creep on\napace; and sometimes the slightest augmentation of disease lays low the enfeebled body!", "But what folly it is, when the beginnings of certain things are situated outside our control, to believe\nthat their endings are within our control! How have I the power to bring something to a close, when I\nhave not had the power to check it at the beginning? For it is easier to keep a thing out than to keep\nit under after you have let it in. Some men have made a distinction as follows, saying: \"If a man has\nself-control and wisdom, he is indeed at peace as regards the attitude and habit of his mind, but not\nas regards the outcome. For, as far as his habit of mind is concerned, he is not perturbed, or\nsaddened, or afraid; but there are many extraneous causes which strike him and bring perturbation\nupon him.\" What they mean to say is this: \"So-and-so is indeed not a man of an angry disposition,\nbut still he sometimes gives way to anger,\" and \"He is not, indeed, inclined to fear, but still he\nsometimes experiences fear\"; in other words, he is free from the fault, but is not free from the\npassion of fear. If, however, fear is once given an entrance, it will by frequent use pass over into a\nvice; and anger, once admitted into the mind, will alter the earlier habit of a mind that was formerly\nfree from anger. Besides, if the wise man, instead of despising all causes that come from without,\never fears anything, when the time arrives for him to go bravely to meet the spear, or the flames, on\nbehalf of his country, his laws, and his liberty, he will go forth reluctantly and with flagging spirit.\nSuch inconsistency of mind, however, does not suit the character of a wise man.", "Then, again, we should see to it that two principles which ought to be tested separately should not\nbe confused. For the conclusion is reached independently that that alone is good which is\nhonourable, and again independently the conclusion that virtue is sufficient for the happy life. If that\nalone is good which is honourable, everyone agrees that virtue is sufficient for the purpose of living\nhappily; but, on the contrary, if virtue alone makes men happy, it will not be conceded that that alone\nis good which is honourable. Xenocrates and Speusippus hold that a man can become happy even\nby virtue alone, not, however, that that which is honourable is the only good. Epicurus also decides\nthat one who possesses virtue is happy, but that virtue of itself is not sufficient for the happy life,\nbecause the pleasure that results from virtue, and not virtue itself, makes one happy. This is a futile\ndistinction. For the same philosopher declares that virtue never exists without pleasure; and\ntherefore, if virtue is always connected with pleasure and always inseparable therefrom, virtue is of\nitself sufficient. For virtue keeps pleasure in its company, and does not exist without it, even when\nalone. But it is absurd to say that a man will be happy by virtue alone, and yet not absolutely happy.\nI cannot discover how that may be, since the happy life contains in itself a good that is perfect and\ncannot be excelled, If a man has this good, life is completely happy.", "Now if the life of the gods contains nothing greater or better, and the happy life is divine, then there\nis no further height to which a man can be raised. Also, if the happy life is in want of nothing, then\nevery happy life is perfect; it is happy and at the same time most happy. Have you any doubt that\nthe happy life is the Supreme Good? Accordingly, if it possesses the Supreme Good, it is supremely\nhappy. Just as the Supreme Good does not admit of increase (for what will be superior to that which\nis supreme?), exactly so the happy life cannot be increased either; for it is not without the Supreme\nGood. If then you bring in one man who is \"happier\" than another, you will also bring in one who is\n\"much happier\"; you will then be making countless distinctions in the Supreme Good; although I\nunderstand the Supreme Good to be that good which admits of no degree above itself. If one person\nis less happy than another, it follows that he eagerly desires the life of that other and happier man in\npreference to his own. But the happy man prefers no other man's life to his own. Either of these two\nthings is incredible: that there should be anything left for a happy man to wish for in preference to\nwhat is, or that he should not prefer the thing which is better than what he already has. For certainly,\nthe more prudent he is, the more he will strive after the best, and he will desire to attain it by every\npossible means. But how can one be happy who is still able, or rather who is still bound, to crave\nsomething else? I will tell you what is the source of this error: men do not understand that the happy\nlife is a unit; for it is its essence, and not its extent, that establishes such a life on the noblest plane.\nHence there is complete equality between the life that is long and the life that is short, between that\nwhich is spread out and that which is confined, between that whose influence is felt in many places\nand in many directions, and that which is restricted to one interest. Those who reckon life by\nnumber, or by measure, or by parts, rob it of its distinctive quality. Now, in the happy life, what is the\ndistinctive quality? It is its fulness. Satiety, I think, is the limit to our eating or drinking. A eats more\nand B eats less; what difference does it make? Each is now sated. Or A drinks more and B drinks\nless; what difference does it make? Each is no longer thirsty. Again, A lives for many years and B for\nfewer; no matter, if only A's many years have brought as much happiness as B's few years. He\nwhom you maintain to be \"less happy\" is not happy; the word admits of no diminution.", "One man, when he has done a service to another, is ready to set it down to his account as a favour\nconferred. Another is not ready to do this, but still in his own mind he thinks of the man as his\ndebtor, and he knows what he has done. A third in a manner does not even know what he has done,\nbut he is like a vine which has produced grapes, and seeks for nothing more after it has once\nproduced its proper fruit. As a horse when he has run, a dog when he has tracked the game, a bee\nwhen it has made the honey, so a man when he has done a good act, does not call out for others to\ncome and see, but he goes on to another act, as a vine goes on to produce again the grapes in\nseason.- Must a man then be one of these, who in a manner act thus without observing it?- Yes.-\nBut this very thing is necessary, the observation of what a man is doing: for, it may be said, it is\ncharacteristic of the social animal to perceive that he is working in a social manner, and indeed to\nwish that his social partner also should perceive it.- It is true what thou sayest, but thou dost not\nrightly understand what is now said: and for this reason thou wilt become one of those of whom I\nspoke before, for even they are misled by a certain show of reason. But if thou wilt choose to\nunderstand the meaning of what is said, do not fear that for this reason thou wilt omit any social act.", "\"He who is brave is fearless; he who is fearless is free from sadness; he who is free from sadness is\nhappy.\" It is our own school which has framed this syllogism; they attempt to refute it by this answer,\nnamely, that we Stoics are assuming as admitted a premiss which is false and distinctly\ncontroverted, ? that the brave man is fearless. \"What!\" they say, \"will the brave man have no fear of\nevils that threaten him? That would be the condition of a madman, a lunatic, rather than of a brave\nman. The brave man will, it is true, feel fear in only a very slight degree; but he is not absolutely free\nfrom fear.\" Now those who assert this are doubling back to their old argument, in that they regard\nvices of less degree as equivalent to virtues. For indeed the man who does feel fear, though he\nfeels it rather seldom and to a slight degree, is not free from wickedness, but is merely troubled by it\nin a milder form. \"Not so,\" is the reply, \"for I hold that a man is mad if he does not fear evils which\nhang over his head.\" What you say is perfectly true, if the things which threaten are really evils; but if\nhe knows that they are not evils and believes that the only evil is baseness, he will be bound to face\ndangers without anxiety and to despise things which other men cannot help fearing. Or, if it is the\ncharacteristic of a fool and a madman not to fear evils, then the wiser a man is the more he will fear\nsuch things! \"It is the doctrine of you Stoics, then,\" they reply, \"that a brave man will expose himself\nto dangers.\" By no means; he will merely not fear them, though he will avoid them. It is proper for\nhim to be careful, but not to be fearful. \"What then? Is he not to fear death, imprisonment, burning,\nand all the other missiles of Fortune?\" Not at all; for he knows that they are not evils, but only seem\nto be. He reckons all these things as the bugbears of man's existence. Paint him a picture of\nslavery, lashes, chains, want, mutilation by disease or by torture, ? or anything else you may care to\nmention; he will count all such things as terrors caused by the derangement of the mind. These\nthings are only to be feared by those who are fearful. Or do you regard as an evil that to which some\nday we may be compelled to resort of our own free will?", "What then, you ask, is an evil? It is the yielding to those things which are called evils; it is the\nsurrendering of one's liberty into their control, when really we ought to suffer all things in order to\npreserve this liberty. Liberty is lost unless we despise those things which put the yoke upon our\nnecks. If men knew what bravery was, they would have no doubts as to what a brave man's conduct\nshould be. For bravery is not thoughtless rashness, or love of danger, or the courting of\nfear-inspiring objects; it is the knowledge which enables us to distinguish between that which is evil\nand that which is not. Bravery takes the greatest care of itself, and likewise endures with the\ngreatest patience all things which have a false appearance of being evils. \"What then?\" is the query;\n\"if the sword is brandished over your brave man's neck, if he is pierced in this place and in that\ncontinually, if he sees his entrails in his lap, if he is tortured again after being kept waiting in order\nthat he may thus feel the torture more keenly, and if the blood flows afresh out of bowels where it\nhas but lately ceased to flow, has he no fear? Shall you say that he has felt no pain either?\" Yes, he\nhas felt pain; for no human virtue can rid itself of feelings. But he has no fear; unconquered he looks\ndown from a lofty height upon his sufferings. Do you ask me what spirit animates him in these\ncircumstances? It is the spirit of one who is comforting a sick friend.", "\"That which is evil does harm; that which does harm makes a man worse. But pain and poverty do\nnot make a man worse; therefore they are not evils.\" \"Your proposition,\" says the objector, \"is\nwrong; for what harms one does not necessarily make one worse. The storm and the squall work\nharm to the pilot, but they do not make a worse pilot of him for all that.\" Certain of the Stoic school\nreply to this argument as follows: \"The pilot becomes a worse pilot because of storms or squalls,\ninasmuch as he cannot carry out his purpose and hold to his course; as far as his art is concerned,\nhe becomes no worse a pilot, but in his work he does become worse.\" To this the Peripatetics retort:\n\"Therefore, poverty will make even the wise man worse, and so will pain, and so will anything else of\nthat sort. For although those things will not rob him of his virtue, yet they will hinder the work of\nvirtue.\" This would be a correct statement, were it not for the fact that the pilot and the wise man are\ntwo different kinds of person. The wise man's purpose in conducting his life is not to accomplish at\nall hazards what he tries, but to do all things rightly; the pilot's purpose, however, is to bring his ship\ninto port at all hazards. The arts are handmaids; they must accomplish what they promise to do. But\nwisdom is mistress and ruler. The arts render a slave's service to life; wisdom issues the\ncommands.", "For myself, I maintain that a different answer should be given: that the pilot's art is never made\nworse by the storm, nor the application of his art either. The pilot has promised you, not a\nprosperous voyage, but a serviceable performance of his task ? that is, an expert knowledge of\nsteering a ship. And the more he is hampered by the stress of fortune, so much the more does his\nknowledge become apparent. He who has been able to say, \"Neptune, you shall never sink this ship\nexcept on an even keel,\" has fulfilled the requirements of his art; the storm does not interfere with\nthe pilot's work, but only with his success. \"What then,\" you say, \"is not a pilot harmed by any\ncircumstance which does not permit him to make port, frustrates all his efforts, and either carries him\nout to sea, or holds the ship in irons, or strips her masts?\" No, it does not harm him as a pilot, but\nonly as a voyager; otherwise, he is no pilot. It is indeed so far from hindering the pilot's art that it\neven exhibits the art; for anyone, in the words of the proverb, is a pilot on a calm sea. These\nmishaps obstruct the voyage but not the steersman qua steersman. A pilot has a double r\u00f4le: one\nhe shares with all his fellow-passengers, for he also is a passenger; the other is peculiar to him, for\nhe is the pilot. The storm harms him as a passenger, but not as a pilot. Again, the pilot's art is\nanother's good ? it concerns his passengers just as a physician's art concerns his patients. But the\nwise man's good is a common good ? it belongs both to those in whose company he lives, and to\nhimself also. Hence our pilot may perhaps be harmed, since his services, which have been\npromised to others, are hindered by the storm; but the wise man is not harmed by poverty, or by\npain, or by any other of life's storms. For all his functions are not checked, but only those which\npertain to others; he himself is always in action, and is greatest in performance at the very time\nwhen fortune has blocked his way. For then he is actually engaged in the business of wisdom; and\nthis wisdom I have declared already to be, both the good of others, and also his own. Besides, he is\nnot prevented from helping others, even at the time when constraining circumstances press him\ndown. Because of his poverty he is prevented from showing how the State should be handled; but\nhe teaches, none the less, how poverty should be handled. His work goes on throughout his whole\nlife.", "Thus no fortune, no external circumstance, can shut off the wise man from action. For the very thing\nwhich engages his attention prevents him from attending to other things. He is ready for either\noutcome: if it brings goods, he controls them; if evils, he conquers them. So thoroughly, I mean, has\nhe schooled himself that he makes manifest his virtue in prosperity as well as in adversity, and\nkeeps his eyes on virtue itself, not on the objects with which virtue deals. Hence neither poverty, nor\npain, nor anything else that deflects the inexperienced and drives them headlong, restrains him from\nhis course. Do you suppose that he is weighed down by evils? He makes use of them. It was not of\nivory only that Phidias knew how to make statues; he also made statues of bronze. If you had given\nhim marble, or a still meaner material, he would have made of it the best statue that the material\nwould permit. So the wise man will develop virtue, if he may, in the midst of wealth, or, if not, in\npoverty; if possible, in his own country ? if not, in exile; if possible, as a commander ? if not, as a\ncommon soldier; if possible, in sound health ? if not, enfeebled. Whatever fortune he finds, he will\naccomplish therefrom something noteworthy.", "Animal-tamers are unerring; they take the most savage animals, which may well terrify those who\nencounter them, and subdue them to the will of man; not content with having driven out their\nferocity, they even tame them so that they dwell in the same abode. The trainer puts his hand into\nthe lion's mouth; the tiger is kissed by his keeper. The tiny Aethiopian orders the elephant to sink\ndown on its knees, or to walk the rope. Similarly, the wise man is a skilled hand at taming evils.\nPain, want, disgrace, imprisonment, exile, ? these are universally to be feared; but when they\nencounter the wise man, they are tamed. Farewell.", "I am resting at the country-house which once belonged to Scipio Africanus himself; and I write to\nyou after doing reverence to his spirit and to an altar which I am inclined to think is the tomb of that\ngreat warrior. That his soul has indeed returned to the skies, whence it came, I am convinced, not\nbecause he commanded mighty armies ? for Cambyses also had mighty armies, and Cambyses\nwas a madman who made successful use of his madness ? but because he showed moderation\nand a sense of duty to a marvellous extent. I regard this trait in him as more admirable after his\nwithdrawal from his native land than while he was defending her; for there was the alternative:\nScipio should remain in Rome, or Rome should remain free. \"It is my wish,\" said he, \"not to infringe\nin the least upon our laws, or upon our customs; let all Roman citizens have equal rights. O my\ncountry, make the most of the good that I have done, but without me. I have been the cause of your\nfreedom, and I shall also be its proof; I go into exile, if it is true that I have grown beyond what is to\nyour advantage!\"", "What can I do but admire this magnanimity, which led him to withdraw into voluntary exile and to\nrelieve the state of its burden? Matters had gone so far that either liberty must work harm to Scipio,\nor Scipio to liberty. Either of these things was wrong in the sight of heaven. So he gave way to the\nlaws and withdrew to Liternum, thinking to make the state a debtor for his own exile no less than for\nthe exile of Hannibal.", "I have inspected the house, which is constructed of hewn stone; the wall which encloses a forest;\nthe towers also, buttressed out on both sides for the purpose of defending the house; the well,\nconcealed among buildings and shrubbery, large enough to keep a whole army supplied; and the\nsmall bath, buried in darkness according to the old style, for our ancestors did not think that one\ncould have a hot bath except in darkness. It was therefore a great pleasure to me to contrast\nScipio's ways with our own. Think, in this tiny recess the \"terror of Carthage,\" to whom Rome should\noffer thanks because she was not captured more than once, used to bathe a body wearied with\nwork in the fields! For he was accustomed to keep himself busy and to cultivate the soil with his own\nhands, as the good old Romans were wont to do. Beneath this dingy roof he stood; and this floor,\nmean as it is, bore his weight.", "But who in these days could bear to bathe in such a fashion? We think ourselves poor and mean if\nour walls are not resplendent with large and costly mirrors; if our marbles from Alexandria are not\nset off by mosaics of Numidian stone, if their borders are not faced over on all sides with difficult\npatterns, arranged in many colours like paintings; if our vaulted ceilings are not buried in glass; if our\nswimming-pools are not lined with Thasian marble, once a rare and wonderful sight in any temple ?\npools into which we let down our bodies after they have been drained weak by abundant\nperspiration; and finally, if the water has not poured from silver spigots. I have so far been speaking\nof the ordinary bathing-establishments; what shall I say when I come to those of the freedmen?\nWhat a vast number of statues, of columns that support nothing, but are built for decoration, merely\nin order to spend money! And what masses of water that fall crashing from level to level! We have\nbecome so luxurious that we will have nothing but precious stones to walk upon.", "A prayer of the Athenians: Rain, rain, O dear Zeus, down on the ploughed fields of the Athenians\nand on the plains.- In truth we ought not to pray at all, or we ought to pray in this simple and noble\nfashion.", "In this bath of Scipio's there are tiny chinks ? you cannot call them windows ? cut out of the stone\nwall in such a way as to admit light without weakening the fortifications; nowadays, however, people\nregard baths as fit only for moths if they have not been so arranged that they receive the sun all day\nlong through the widest of windows, if men cannot bathe and get a coat of tan at the same time, and\nif they cannot look out from their bath-tubs over stretches of land and sea. So it goes; the\nestablishments which had drawn crowds and had won admiration when they were first opened are\navoided and put back in the category of venerable antiques as soon as luxury has worked out some\nnew device, to her own ultimate undoing. In the early days, however, there were few baths, and they\nwere not fitted out with any display. For why should men elaborately fit out that which, costs a penny\nonly, and was invented for use, not merely for delight? The bathers of those days did not have water\npoured over them, nor did it always run fresh as if from a hot spring; and they did not believe that it\nmattered at all how perfectly pure was the water into which they were to leave their dirt. Ye gods,\nwhat a pleasure it is to enter that dark bath, covered with a common sort of roof, knowing that\ntherein your hero Cato, as aedile, or Fabius Maximus, or one of the Cornelii, has warmed the water\nwith his own hands! For this also used to be the duty of the noblest aediles ? to enter these places\nto which the populace resorted, and to demand that they be cleaned and warmed to a heat required\nby considerations of use and health, not the heat that men have recently made fashionable, as great\nas a conflagration ? so much so, indeed, that a slave condemned for some criminal offence now\nought to be bathed alive! It seems to me that nowadays there is no difference between \"the bath is\non fire,\" and \"the bath is warm.\"", "How some persons nowadays condemn Scipio as a boor because he did not let daylight into his\nperspiring-room through wide windows, or because he did not roast in the strong sunlight and\ndawdle about until he could stew in the hot water! \"Poor fool,\" they say, \"he did not know how to live!\nHe did not bathe in filtered water; it was often turbid, and after heavy rains almost muddy!\" But it did\nnot matter much to Scipio if he had to bathe in that way; he went there to wash off sweat, not\nointment. And how do you suppose certain persons will answer me? They will say: \"I don't envy\nScipio; that was truly an exile's life ? to put up with baths like those!\" Friend, if you were wiser, you\nwould know that Scipio did not bathe every day. It is stated by those who have reported to us the\nold-time ways of Rome that the Romans washed only their arms and legs daily ? because those\nwere the members which gathered dirt in their daily toil ? and bathed all over only once a week.\nHere someone will retort: \"Yes; pretty dirty fellows they evidently were! How they must have\nsmelled!\" But they smelled of the camp, the farm, and heroism. Now that spick-and-span bathing\nestablishments have been devised, men are really fouler than of yore. What says Horatius Flaccus,\nwhen he wishes to describe a scoundrel, one who is notorious for his extreme luxury? He says:\n\"Buccillus smells of perfume.\" Show me a Buccillus in these days; his smell would be the veritable\ngoat-smell ? he would take the place of the Gargonius with whom Horace in the same passage\ncontrasted him. It is nowadays not enough to use ointment, unless you put on a fresh coat two or\nthree times a day, to keep it from evaporating on the body. But why should a man boast of this\nperfume as if it were his own?", "If what I am saying shall seem to you too pessimistic, charge it up against Scipio's country-house,\nwhere I have learned a lesson from Aegialus, a most careful householder and now the owner of this\nestate; he taught me that a tree can be transplanted, no matter how far gone in years. We old men\nmust learn this precept; for there is none of us who is not planting an olive-yard for his successor. I\nhave seen them bearing fruit in due season after three or four years of unproductiveness. And you\ntoo shall be shaded by the tree which", "as our poet Vergil says. Vergil sought, however, not what was nearest to the truth, but what was\nmost appropriate, and aimed, not to teach the farmer, but to please the reader. For example,\nomitting all other errors of his, I will quote the passage in which it was incumbent upon me to-day to\ndetect a fault:", "Thou'rt welcomed by the crumbling furrows; and\nThe millet calls for yearly care.", "You may judge by the following incident whether those plants should be set out at the same time, or\nwhether both should be sowed in the spring. It is June at the present writing, and we are well on\ntowards July; and I have seen on this very day farmers harvesting beans and sowing millet.", "But to return to our olive-yard again. I saw it planted in two ways. If the trees were large, Aegialus\ntook their trunks and cut off the branches to the length of one foot each; he then transplanted along\nwith the ball, after cutting off the roots, leaving only the thick part from which the roots hang. He\nsmeared this with manure, and inserted it in the hole, not only heaping up the earth about it, but\nstamping and pressing it down. There is nothing, he says, more effective than this packing process;\nin other words, it keeps out the cold and the wind. Besides, the trunk is not shaken so much, and for\nthis reason the packing makes it possible for the young roots to come out and get a hold in the soil.\nThese are of necessity still soft; they have but a slight hold, and a very little shaking uproots them.\nThis ball, moreover, Aegialus lops clean before he covers it up. For he maintains that new roots\nspring from all the parts which have been shorn. Moreover, the trunk itself should not stand more\nthan three or four feet out of the ground. For there will thus be at once a thick growth from the\nbottom, nor will there be a large stump, all dry and withered, as is the case with old olive-yards. The\nsecond way of setting them out was the following: he set out in similar fashion branches that were\nstrong and of soft bark, as those of young saplings are wont to be. These grow a little more slowly,\nbut, since they spring from what is practically a cutting, there is no roughness or ugliness in them.", "This too I have seen recently ? an aged vine transplanted from its own plantation. In this case, the\nfibres also should be gathered together, if possible, and then you should cover up the vine-stem\nmore generously, so that roots may spring up even from the stock. I have seen such plantings made\nnot only in February, but at the very end of March; the plants take hold of and embrace alien elms.\nBut all trees, he declares, which are, so to speak, \"thick-stemmed,\" should be assisted with\ntank-water; if we have this help, we are our own rain-makers.", "Just as we must understand when it is said, That Aesculapius prescribed to this man\nhorse-exercise, or bathing in cold water or going without shoes; so we must understand it when it is\nsaid, That the nature of the universe prescribed to this man disease or mutilation or loss or anything\nelse of the kind. For in the first case Prescribed means something like this: he prescribed this for this\nman as a thing adapted to procure health; and in the second case it means: That which happens to\n(or, suits) every man is fixed in a manner for him suitably to his destiny. For this is what we mean\nwhen we say that things are suitable to us, as the workmen say of squared stones in walls or the\npyramids, that they are suitable, when they fit them to one another in some kind of connexion. For\nthere is altogether one fitness, harmony. And as the universe is made up out of all bodies to be such\na body as it is, so out of all existing causes necessity (destiny) is made up to be such a cause as it\nis. And even those who are completely ignorant understand what I mean, for they say, It (necessity,\ndestiny) brought this to such a person.- This then was brought and this was precribed to him. Let us\nthen receive these things, as well as those which Aesculapius prescribes. Many as a matter of\ncourse even among his prescriptions are disagreeable, but we accept them in the hope of health.\nLet the perfecting and accomplishment of the things, which the common nature judges to be good,\nbe judged by thee to be of the same kind as thy health. And so accept everything which happens,\neven if it seem disagreeable, because it leads to this, to the health of the universe and to the\nprosperity and felicity of Zeus (the universe). For he would not have brought on any man what he\nhas brought, if it were not useful for the whole. Neither does the nature of anything, whatever it may\nbe, cause anything which is not suitable to that which is directed by it. For two reasons then it is right\nto be content with that which happens to thee; the one, because it was done for thee and prescribed\nfor thee, and in a manner had reference to thee, originally from the most ancient causes spun with\nthy destiny; and the other, because even that which comes severally to every man is to the power\nwhich administers the universe a cause of felicity and perfection, nay even of its very continuance.\nFor the integrity of the whole is mutilated, if thou cuttest off anything whatever from the conjunction\nand the continuity either of the parts or of the causes. And thou dost cut off, as far as it is in thy", "power, when thou art dissatisfied, and in a manner triest to put anything out of the way.", "I do not intend to tell you any more of these precepts, lest, as Aegialus did with me, I may be\ntraining you up to be my competitor.

For what is more agreeable than wisdom itself,\nwhen thou thinkest of the security and the happy course of all things which depend on the faculty of\nunderstanding and knowledge?", "\"That which can fall to the lot of any man, no matter how base or despised he may be, is not a good.\nBut wealth falls to the lot of the pander and the trainer of gladiators; therefore wealth is not a good.\"\n\"Another wrong premiss,\" they say, \"for we notice that goods fall to the lot of the very lowest sort of\nmen, not only in the scholar's art, but also in the art of healing or in the art of navigating.\" These arts,\nhowever, make no profession of greatness of soul; they do not rise to any heights nor do they frown\nupon what fortune may bring. It is virtue that uplifts man and places him superior to what mortals\nhold dear; virtue neither craves overmuch nor fears to excess that which is called good or that which\nis called bad. Chelidon, one of Cleopatra's eunuchs, possessed great wealth; and recently Natalis ?\na man whose tongue was as shameless as it was dirty, a man whose mouth used to perform the\nvilest offices ? was the heir of many, and also made many his heirs. What then? Was it his money\nthat made him unclean, or did he himself besmirch his money? Money tumbles into the hands of\ncertain men as a shilling tumbles down a sewer. Virtue stands above all such things. It is appraised\nin coin of its own minting; and it deems none of these random windfalls to be good. But medicine\nand navigation do not forbid themselves and their followers to marvel at such things. One who is not\na good man can nevertheless be a physician, or a pilot, or a scholar, ? yes, just as well as he can be\na cook! He to whose lot it falls to possess something which is not of a random sort, cannot be called\na random sort of man; a person is of the same sort as that which he possesses. A strong-box is\nworth just what it holds; or rather, it is a mere accessory of that which it holds. Who ever sets any\nprice upon a full purse except the price established by the count of the money deposited therein?\nThis also applies to the owners of great estates: they are only accessories and incidentals to their\npossessions.", "Why, then, is the wise man great? Because he has a great soul. Accordingly, it is true that that\nwhich falls to the lot even of the most despicable person is not a good. Thus, I should never regard\ninactivity as a good; for even the tree-frog and the flea possess this quality. Nor should I regard rest\nand freedom from trouble as a good; for what is more at leisure than a worm? Do you ask what it is\nthat produces the wise man? That which produces a god. You must grant that the wise man has in\nan element of godliness, heavenliness, grandeur. The good does not come to every one, nor does it\nallow any random person to possess it. Behold:", "Here corn, and there the vine, grow richlier.\nAnd elsewhere still the tender tree and grass\nUnbidden clothe themselves in green. Seest thou\nHow Tmolus ships its saffron perfumes forth,\nAnd ivory comes from Ind; soft Sheba sends\nIts incense, and the unclad Chalybes\nTheir iron.", "These products are apportioned to separate countries in order that human beings may be\nconstrained to traffic among themselves, each seeking something from his neighbour in his turn. So\nthe Supreme Good has also its own abode. It does not grow where ivory grows, or iron. Do you ask\nwhere the Supreme Good dwells? In the soul. And unless the soul be pure and holy, there is no\nroom in it for God.", "\"Good does not result from evil. But riches result from greed; therefore, riches are not a good.\" \"It is\nnot true,\" they say, \"that good does not result from evil. For money comes from sacrilege and theft.\nAccordingly, although sacrilege and theft are evil, yet they are evil only because they work more evil\nthan good. For they bring gain; but the gain is accompanied by fear, anxiety, and torture of mind and\nbody.\" Whoever says this\nmust perforce admit that sacrilege, though it be an evil because it works much evil, is yet partly good\nbecause it accomplishes a certain amount of good. What can be more monstrous than this? We\nhave, to be sure, actually convinced the world that sacrilege, theft, and adultery are to be regarded\nas among the goods. How many men there are who do not blush at theft, how many who boast of\nhaving committed adultery! For petty sacrilege is punished, but sacrilege on a grand scale is\nhonoured by a triumphal procession. Besides, sacrilege, if it is wholly good in some respect, will also\nbe honourable and will be called right conduct; for it is conduct which concerns ourselves. But no\nhuman being, on serious consideration, admits this idea.", "Therefore, goods cannot spring from evil. For if, as you object, sacrilege is an evil for the single\nreason that it brings on much evil, if you but absolve sacrilege of its punishment and pledge it\nimmunity, sacrilege will be wholly good. And yet the worst punishment for crime lies in the crime\nitself. You are mistaken, I maintain, if you propose to reserve your punishments for the hangman or\nthe prison; the crime is punished immediately after it is committed; nay, rather, at the moment when\nit is committed. Hence, good does not spring from evil, any more than figs grow from olive-trees.\nThings which grow correspond to their seed; and goods cannot depart from their class. As that\nwhich is honourable does not grow from that which is base, so neither does good grow from evil. For\nthe honourable and the good are identical.", "Certain of our school oppose this statement as follows: \"Let us suppose that money taken from any\nsource whatsoever is a good; even though it is taken by an act of sacrilege, the money does not on\nthat account derive its origin from sacrilege. You may get my meaning through the following\nillustration: In the same jar there is a piece of gold and there is a serpent. If you take the gold from\nthe jar, it is not just because the serpent is there too, I say, that the jar yields me the gold ? because\nit contains the serpent as well, ? but it yields the gold in spite of containing the serpent also.\nSimilarly, gain results from sacrilege, not just because sacrilege is a base and accursed act, but\nbecause it contains gain also. As the serpent in the jar is an evil, and not the gold which lies there,\nbeside the serpent; so in an act of sacrilege it is the crime, not the profit, that is evil.\" But I differ from\nthese men; for the conditions in each case are not at all the same. In the one instance I can take the\ngold without the serpent, in the other I cannot make the profit without committing the sacrilege. The\ngain in the latter case does not lie side by side with the crime; it is blended with the crime.", "\"That which, while we are desiring to attain it, involves us in many evils, is not a good. But while we\nare desiring to attain riches, we become involved in many evils; therefore, riches are not a good,\"\n\"Your first premiss,\" they say, \"contains two meanings; one is: we become involved in many evils\nwhile we are desiring to attain riches. But we also become involved in many evils while we are\ndesiring to attain virtue. One man, while travelling in order to prosecute his studies, suffers\nshipwreck, and another is taken captive. The second meaning is as follows: that through which we\nbecome involved in evils is not a good. And it will not logically follow from our proposition that we\nbecome involved in evils through riches or through pleasure; otherwise, if it is through riches that we\nbecome involved in many evils, riches are not only not a good, but they are positively an evil. You,\nhowever, maintain merely that they are not a good. Moreover,\" the objector says, \"you grant that\nriches are of some use. You reckon them among the advantages; and yet on this basis they cannot\neven be an advantage, for it is through the pursuit of riches that we suffer much disadvantage.\"\nCertain men answer this objection as follows: \"You are mistaken if you ascribe disadvantages to\nriches. Riches injure no one; it is a man's own folly, or his neighbour's wickedness, that harms him in\neach case, just as a sword by itself does not slay; it is merely the weapon used by the slayer. Riches\nthemselves do not harm you, just because it is on account of riches that you suffer harm.\"", "I think that the reasoning of Posidonius is better: he holds that riches are a cause of evil, not\nbecause, of themselves, they do any evil, but because they goad men on so that they are ready to\ndo evil. For the efficient cause, which necessarily produces harm at once, is one thing, and the\nantecedent cause is another. It is this antecedent cause which inheres in riches; they puff up the\nspirit and beget pride, they bring on unpopularity and unsettle the mind to such an extent that the\nmere reputation of having wealth, though it is bound to harm us, nevertheless affords delight. All\ngoods, however, ought properly to be free from blame; they are pure, they do not corrupt the spirit,\nand they do not tempt us. They do, indeed, uplift and broaden the spirit, but without puffing it up.\nThose things which are goods produce confidence, but riches produce shamelessness. The things\nwhich are goods give us greatness of soul, but riches give us arrogance. And arrogance is nothing\nelse than a false show of greatness.", "Things are in such a kind of envelopment that they have seemed to philosophers, not a few nor\nthose common philosophers, altogether unintelligible; nay even to the Stoics themselves they seem\ndifficult to understand. And all our assent is changeable; for where is the man who never changes?\nCarry thy thoughts then to the objects themselves, and consider how short-lived they are and\nworthless, and that they may be in the possession of a filthy wretch or a whore or a robber. Then\nturn to the morals of those who live with thee, and it is hardly possible to endure even the most\nagreeable of them, to say nothing of a man being hardly able to endure himself. In such darkness\nthen and dirt and in so constant a flux both of substance and of time, and of motion and of things\nmoved, what there is worth being highly prized or even an object of serious pursuit, I cannot\nimagine. But on the contrary it is a man's duty to comfort himself, and to wait for the", "\"According to that argument,\" the objector says, \"riches are not only not a good, but are a positive\nevil.\" Now they would be an evil if they did harm of themselves, and if, as I remarked, it were the\nefficient cause which inheres in them; in fact, however, it is the antecedent cause which inheres in\nriches, and indeed it is that cause which, so far from merely arousing the spirit, actually drags it\nalong by force. Yes, riches shower upon us a semblance of the good, which is like the reality and\nwins credence in the eyes of many men. The antecedent cause inheres in virtue also; it is this which\nbrings on envy ? for many men become unpopular because of their wisdom, and many men\nbecause of their justice. But this cause, though it inheres in virtue, is not the result of virtue itself, nor\nis it a mere semblance of the reality; nay, on the contrary, far more like the reality is that vision which\nis flashed by virtue upon the spirits of men, summoning them to love it and marvel thereat.", "Posidonius thinks that the syllogism should be framed as follows: \"Things which bestow upon the\nsoul no greatness or confidence or freedom from care are not goods. But riches and health and\nsimilar conditions do none of these things; therefore, riches and health are not goods.\" This\nsyllogism he then goes on to extend still further in the following way: \"Things which bestow upon the\nsoul no greatness or confidence or freedom from care, but on the other hand create in it arrogance,\nvanity, and insolence, are evils. But things which are the gift of Fortune drive us into these evil ways.\nTherefore these things are not goods.\" \"But,\" says the objector, \"by such reasoning, things which\nare the gift of Fortune will not even be advantages.\" No, advantages and goods stand each in a\ndifferent situation. An advantage is that which contains more of usefulness than of annoyance. But a\ngood ought to be unmixed and with no element in it of harmfulness. A thing is not good if it contains\nmore benefit than injury, but only if it contains nothing but benefit. Besides, advantages may be\npredicated of animals, of men who are less than perfect, and of fools. Hence the advantageous may\nhave an element of disadvantage mingled with it, but the word \"advantageous\" is used of the\ncompound because it is judged by its predominant element. The good, however, can be predicated\nof the wise man alone; it is bound to be without alloy,", "Be of good cheer; there is only one knot left for you to untangle, though it is a knot for a Hercules:\n\"Good does not result from evil. But riches result from numerous cases of poverty; therefore, riches\nare not a good.\" This syllogism is not recognized by our school, but the Peripatetics both concoct it\nand give its solution. Posidonius, however, remarks that this fallacy, which has been bandied about\namong all the schools of dialectic, is refuted by Antipater as follows: \"The word 'poverty' is used to\ndenote, not the possession of something, but the non-possession or, as the ancients have put it,\ndeprivation, (for the Greeks use the phrase 'by deprivation,' meaning 'negatively'). 'Poverty' states,\nnot what a man has, but what he has not. Consequently there can be no fulness resulting from a\nmultitude of voids; many positive things, and not many deficiencies, make up riches. You have,\"\nsays he, \"a wrong notion of the meaning of what poverty is. For poverty does not mean the\npossession of little, but the non-possession of much; it is used, therefore, not of what a man has, but\nof what he lacks.\" I could express my meaning more easily if there were a Latin word which could\ntranslate the Greek word which means \"not-possessing.\" Antipater assigns this quality to poverty,\nbut for my part I cannot see what else poverty is than the possession of little. If ever we have plenty\nof leisure, we shall investigate the question: What is the essence of riches, and what the essence of\npoverty; but when the time comes, we shall also consider whether it is not better to try to mitigate\npoverty, and to relieve wealth of its arrogance, than to quibble about the words as if the question of\nthe things were already decided.", "Let us suppose that we have been summoned to an assembly; an act dealing with the abolition of\nriches has been brought before the meeting. Shall we be supporting it, or opposing it, if we use\nthese syllogisms? Will these syllogisms help us to bring it about that the Roman people shall\ndemand poverty and praise it ? poverty, the foundation and cause of their empire, ? and, on the\nother hand, shall shrink in fear from their present wealth, reflecting that they have found it among\nthe victims of their conquests, that wealth is the source from which office-seeking and bribery and\ndisorder have burst into a city once characterized by the utmost scrupulousness and sobriety, and\nthat because of wealth an exhibition all too lavish is made of the spoils of conquered nations;\nreflecting, finally, that whatever one people has snatched away from all the rest may still more easily\nbe snatched by all away from one? Nay, it were better to support this law by our conduct and to\nsubdue our desires by direct assault rather than to circumvent them by logic. If we can, let us speak\nmore boldly; if not, let us speak more frankly.", "You have been wishing to know my views with regard to liberal studies. My answer is this: I respect\nno study, and deem no study good, which results in money-making. Such studies are profit-bringing\noccupations, useful only in so far as they give the mind a preparation and do not engage it\npermanently. One should linger upon them only so long as the mind can occupy itself with nothing\ngreater; they are our apprenticeship, not our real work. Hence you see why \"liberal studies\" are so\ncalled; it is because they are studies worthy of a free-born gentleman. But there is only one really\nliberal study, ? that which gives a man his liberty. It is the study of wisdom, and that is lofty, brave,\nand great-souled. All other studies are puny and puerile. You surely do not believe that there is good\nin any of the subjects whose teachers are, as you see, men of the most ignoble and base stamp?\nWe ought not to be learning such things; we should have done with learning them.", "Certain persons have made up their minds that the point at issue with regard to the liberal studies is\nwhether they make men good; but they do not even profess or aim at a knowledge of this particular\nsubject. The scholar busies himself with investigations into language, and if it be his desire to go\nfarther afield, he works on history, or, if he would extend his range to the farthest limits, on poetry.\nBut which of these paves the way to virtue? Pronouncing syllables, investigating words, memorizing\nplays, or making rules for the scansion of poetry, ? what is there in all this that rids one of fear, roots\nout desire, or bridles the passions? The question is: do such men teach virtue, or not? If they do not\nteach it, then neither do they transmit it. If they do teach it, they are philosophers. Would you like to\nknow how it happens that they have not taken the chair for the purpose of teaching virtue? See how\nunlike their subjects are; and yet their subjects would resemble each other if they taught the same\nthing.", "It may be, perhaps, that they make you believe that Homer was a philosopher, although they\ndisprove this by the very arguments through which they seek to prove it. For sometimes they make\nof him a Stoic, who approves nothing but virtue, avoids pleasures, and refuses to relinquish honour\neven at the price of immortality; sometimes they make him an Epicurean, praising the condition of a\nstate in repose, which passes its days in feasting and song; sometimes a Peripatetic, classifying\ngoodness in three ways; sometimes an Academic, holding that all things are uncertain. It is clear,\nhowever, that no one of these doctrines is to be fathered upon Homer, just because they are all\nthere; for they are irreconcilable with one another. We may admit to these men, indeed, that Homer\nwas a philosopher; yet surely he became a wise man before he had any knowledge of poetry. So let\nus learn the particular things that made Homer wise.", "It is no more to the point, of course, for me to investigate whether Homer or Hesiod was the older\npoet, than to know why Hecuba, although younger than Helen, showed her years so lamentably.\nWhat, in your opinion, I say, would be the point in trying to determine the respective ages of Achilles\nand Patroclus? Do you raise the question, \"Through what regions did Ulysses stray?\" instead of\ntrying to prevent ourselves from going astray at all times? We have no leisure to hear lectures on the\nquestion whether he was sea-tost between Italy and Sicily, or outside our known world (indeed, so\nlong a wandering could not possibly have taken place within its narrow bounds); we ourselves\nencounter storms of the spirit, which toss us daily, and our depravity drives us into all the ills which\ntroubled Ulysses. For us there is never lacking the beauty to tempt our eyes, or the enemy to assail\nus; on this side are savage monsters that delight in human blood, on that side the treacherous\nallurements of the ear, and yonder is shipwreck and all the varied category of misfortunes. Show me\nrather, by the example of Ulysses, how I am to love my country, my wife, my father, and how, even\nafter suffering shipwreck, I am to sail toward these ends, honourable as they are. Why try to\ndiscover whether Penelope was a pattern of purity, or whether she had the laugh on her\ncontemporaries? Or whether she suspected that the man in her presence was Ulysses, before she\nknew it was he? Teach me rather what purity is, and how great a good we have in it, and whether it\nis situated in the body or in the soul.", "Now I will transfer my attention to the musician. You, sir, are teaching me how the treble and the\nbass are in accord with one another, and how, though the strings produce different notes, the result\nis a harmony; rather bring my soul into harmony with itself, and let not my purposes be out of tune.\nYou are showing me what the doleful keys are; show me rather how, in the midst of adversity, I may\nkeep from uttering a doleful note. The mathematician teaches me how to lay out the dimensions of\nmy estates; but I should rather be taught how to lay out what is enough for a man to own. He\nteaches me to count, and adapts my fingers to avarice; but I should prefer him to teach me that\nthere is no point in such calculations, and that one is none the happier for tiring out the\nbook-keepers with his possessions ? or rather, how useless property is to any man who would find it\nthe greatest misfortune if he should be required to reckon out, by his own wits, the amount of his\nholdings. What good is there for me in knowing how to parcel out a piece of land, if I know not how\nto share it with my brother? What good is there in working out to a nicety the dimensions of an acre,\nand in detecting the error if a piece has so much as escaped my measuring-rod, if I am embittered\nwhen an ill-tempered neighbour merely scrapes off a bit of my land? The mathematician teaches me\nhow I may lose none of my boundaries; I, however, seek to learn how to lose them all with a light\nheart. \"But,\" comes the reply, \"I am being driven from the farm which my father and grandfather\nowned!\" Well? Who owned the land before your grandfather? Can you explain what people (I will not\nsay what person) held it originally? You did not enter upon it as a master, but merely as a tenant.\nAnd whose tenant are you? If your claim is successful, you are tenant of the heir.

For just as I know that all things can happen, so I\nknow, too, that they will not happen in every case.

For I do not consent to\nadmit painting into the list of liberal arts, any more than sculpture, marble-working, and other helps\ntoward luxury. I also debar from the liberal studies wrestling and all knowledge that is compounded\nof oil and mud; otherwise, I should be compelled to admit perfumers also, and cooks, and all others\nwho lend their wits to the service of our pleasures. For what \"liberal\" element is there in these\nravenous takers of emetics, whose bodies are fed to fatness while their minds are thin and dull? Or\ndo we really believe that the training which they give is \"liberal\" for the young men of Rome, who\nused to be taught by our ancestors to stand straight and hurl a spear, to wield a pike, to guide a\nhorse, and to handle weapons? Our ancestors used to teach their children nothing that could be\nlearned while lying down. But neither the new system nor the old teaches or nourishes virtue. For\nwhat good does it do us to guide a horse and control his speed with the curb, and then find that our\nown passions, utterly uncurbed, bolt with us? Or to beat many opponents in wrestling or boxing, and\nthen to find that we ourselves are beaten by anger?", "\"What then,\" you say, \"do the liberal studies contribute nothing to our welfare?\" Very much in other\nrespects, but nothing at all as regards virtue. For even these arts of which I have spoken, though\nadmittedly of a low grade ? depending as they do upon handiwork ? contribute greatly toward the\nequipment of life, but nevertheless have nothing to do with virtue. And if you inquire, \"Why, then, do\nwe educate our children in the liberal studies?\" it is not because they can bestow virtue, but because\nthey prepare the soul for the reception of virtue. Just as that \"primary course,\" as the ancients called\nit, in grammar, which gave boys their elementary training, does not teach them the liberal arts, but\nprepares the ground for their early acquisition of these arts, so the liberal arts do not conduct the\nsoul all the way to virtue, but merely set it going in that direction.", "Posidonius divides the arts into four classes: first we have those which are common and low, then\nthose which serve for amusement, then those which refer to the education of boys, and, finally, the\nliberal arts. The common sort belong to workmen and are mere hand-work; they are concerned with\nequipping life; there is in them no pretence to beauty or honour. The arts of amusement are those\nwhich aim to please the eye and the ear. To this class you may assign the stage-machinists, who\ninvent scaffolding that goes aloft of its own accord, or floors that rise silently into the air, and many\nother surprising devices, as when objects that fit together then fall apart, or objects which are\nseparate then join together automatically, or objects which stand erect then gradually collapse. The\neye of the inexperienced is struck with amazement by these things; for such persons marvel at\neverything that takes place without warning, because they do not know the causes. The arts which\nbelong to the education of boys, and are somewhat similar to the liberal arts, are those which the\nGreeks call the \"cycle of studies,\" but which we Romans call the \"liberal.\" However, those alone are\nreally liberal ? or rather, to give them a truer name, \"free\" ? whose concern is virtue.", "\"But,\" one will say, \"just as there is a part of philosophy which has to do with nature, and a part\nwhich has to do with ethics, and a part which has to do with reasoning, so this group of liberal arts\nalso claims for itself a place in philosophy. When one approaches questions that deal with nature, a\ndecision is reached by means of a word from the mathematician. Therefore mathematics is a\ndepartment of that branch which it aids.\" But many things aid us and yet are not parts of ourselves.\nNay, if they were, they would not aid us. Food is an aid to the body, but is not a part of it. We get\nsome help from the service which mathematics renders; and mathematics is as indispensable to\nphilosophy as the carpenter is to the mathematician. But carpentering is not a part of mathematics,\nnor is mathematics a part of philosophy. Moreover, each has its own limits; for the wise man\ninvestigates and learns the causes of natural phenomena, while the mathematician follows up and\ncomputes their numbers and their measurements. The wise man knows the laws by which the\nheavenly bodies persist, what powers belong to them, and what attributes; the astronomer merely\nnotes their comings and goings, the rules which govern their settings and their risings, and the\noccasional periods during which they seem to stand still, although as a matter of fact no heavenly\nbody can stand still. The wise man will know what causes the reflection in a mirror; but, the\nmathematician can merely tell you how far the body should be from the reflection, and what shape\nof mirror will produce a given reflection. The philosopher will demonstrate that the sun is a large\nbody, while the astronomer will compute just how large, progressing in knowledge by his method of\ntrial and experiment; but in order to progress, he must summon to his aid certain principles. No art,\nhowever, is sufficient unto itself, if the foundation upon which it rests depends upon mere favour.\nNow philosophy asks no favours from any other source; it builds everything on its own soil; but the\nscience of numbers is, so to speak, a structure built on another man's land ? it builds on alien soil. It\naccepts first principles, and by their favour arrives at further conclusions. If it could march unassisted\nto the truth, if it were able to understand the nature of the universe, I should say that it would offer\nmuch assistance to our minds; for the mind grows by contact with things heavenly, and draws into\nitself something from on high. There is but one thing that brings the soul to perfection ? the", "unalterable knowledge of good and evil. But there is no other art which investigates good and evil.", "I should like to pass in review the several virtues. Bravery is a scorner of things which inspire fear; it\nlooks down upon, challenges, and crushes the powers of terror and all that would drive our freedom\nunder the yoke. But do \"liberal studies\" strengthen this virtue? Loyalty is the holiest good in the\nhuman heart; it is forced into betrayal by no constraint, and it is bribed by no rewards. Loyalty cries:\n\"Burn me, slay me, kill me! I shall not betray my trust; and the more urgently torture shall seek to\nfind my secret, the deeper in my heart will I bury it!\" Can the \"liberal arts\" produce such a spirit within\nus? Temperance controls our desires; some it hates and routs, others it regulates and restores to a\nhealthy measure, nor does it ever approach our desires for their own sake. Temperance knows that\nthe best measure of the appetites is not what you want to take, but what you ought to take.\nKindliness forbids you to be over-bearing towards your associates, and it forbids you to be grasping.\nIn words and in deeds and in feelings it shows itself gentle and courteous to all men. It counts no\nevil as another's solely. And the reason why it loves its own good is chiefly because it will some day\nbe the good of another. Do \"liberal studies\" teach a man such character as this? No; no more than\nthey teach simplicity, moderation and self-restraint, thrift and economy, and that kindliness which\nspares a neighbour's life as if it were one's own and knows that it is not for man to make wasteful\nuse of his fellow-man.", "About what am I now employing my own soul? On every occasion I must ask myself this question,\nand inquire, what have I now in this part of me which they call the ruling principle? And whose soul\nhave I now? That of a child, or of a young man, or of a feeble woman, or of a tyrant, or of a domestic\nanimal, or of a wild beast?", "\"But,\" one says, \"since you declare that virtue cannot be attained without the 'liberal studies,' how is\nit that you deny that they offer any assistance to virtue?\" Because you cannot attain virtue without\nfood, either; and yet food has nothing to do with virtue. Wood does not offer assistance to a ship,\nalthough a ship cannot be built except of wood. There is no reason, I say, why you should think that\nanything is made by the assistance of that without which it cannot be made. We might even make\nthe statement that it is possible to attain wisdom without the \"liberal studies\"; for although virtue is a\nthing that must be learned, yet it is not learned by means of these studies.", "What reason have I, however, for supposing that one who is ignorant of letters will never be a wise\nman, since wisdom is not to be found in letters? Wisdom communicates facts and not words; and it\nmay be true that the memory is more to be depended upon when it has no support outside itself.\nWisdom is a large and spacious thing. It needs plenty of free room. One must learn about things\ndivine and human, the past and the future, the ephemeral and the eternal; and one must learn about\nTime. See how many questions arise concerning time alone: in the first place, whether it is anything\nin and by itself; in the second place, whether anything exists prior to time and without time; and\nagain, did time begin along with the universe, or, because there was something even before the\nuniverse began, did time also exist then? There are countless questions concerning the soul alone:\nwhence it comes, what is its nature, when it begins to exist, and how long it exists; whether it passes\nfrom one place to another and changes its habitation, being transferred successively from one\nanimal shape to another, or whether it is a slave but once, roaming the universe after it is set free;\nwhether it is corporeal or not; what will become of it when it ceases to use us as its medium; how it\nwill employ its freedom when it has escaped from this present prison; whether it will forget all its\npast, and at that moment begin to know itself when, released from the body, it has withdrawn to the\nskies.", "Thus, whatever phase of things human and divine you have apprehended, you will be wearied by\nthe vast number of things to be answered and things to be learned. And in order that these manifold\nand mighty subjects may have free entertainment in your soul, you must remove therefrom all\nsuperfluous things. Virtue will not surrender herself to these narrow bounds of ours; a great subject\nneeds wide space in which to move. Let all other things be driven out, and let the breast be emptied\nto receive virtue.", "\"But it is a pleasure to be acquainted with many arts.\" Therefore let us keep only as much of them\nas is essential. Do you regard that man as blameworthy who puts superfluous things on the same\nfooting with useful things, and in his house makes a lavish display of costly objects, but do not deem\nhim blameworthy who has allowed himself to become engrossed with the useless furniture of\nlearning? This desire to know more than is sufficient is a sort of intemperance. Why? Because this\nunseemly pursuit of the liberal arts makes men troublesome, wordy, tactless, self-satisfied bores,\nwho fail to learn the essentials just because they have learned the non-essentials. Didymus the\nscholar wrote four thousand books. I should feel pity for him if he had only read the same number of\nsuperfluous volumes. In these books he investigates Homer's birthplace, who was really the mother\nof Aeneas, whether Anacreon was more of a rake or more of a drunkard, whether Sappho was a\nbad lot, and other problems the answers to which, if found, were forthwith to be forgotten. Come\nnow, do not tell me that life is long! Nay, when you come to consider our own countrymen also, I can\nshow you many works which ought to be cut down with the axe.", "It is at the cost of a vast outlay of time and of vast discomfort to the ears of others that we win such\npraise as this: \"What a learned man you are!\" Let us be content with this recommendation, less\ncitified though it be: \"What a good man you are!\" Do I mean this? Well, would you have me unroll\nthe annals of the world's history and try to find out who first wrote poetry? Or, in the absence of\nwritten records, shall I make an estimate of the number of years which lie between Orpheus and\nHomer? Or shall I make a study of the absurd writings of Aristarchus, wherein he branded the text of\nother men's verses, and wear my life away upon syllables? Shall I then wallow in the geometrician's\ndust? Have I so far forgotten that useful saw \"Save your time\"? Must I know these things? And what\nmay I choose not to know?", "Apion, the scholar, who drew crowds to his lectures all over Greece in the days of Gaius Caesar and\nwas acclaimed a Homerid by every state, used to maintain that Homer, when he had finished his\ntwo poems, the Iliad and the Odyssey, added a preliminary poem to his work, wherein he embraced\nthe whole Trojan war. The argument which Apion adduced to prove this statement was that Homer\nhad purposely inserted in the opening line two letters which contained a key to the number of his\nbooks. A man who wishes to know many things must know such things as these, and must take no\nthought of all the time which one loses by ill-health, public duties, private duties, daily duties, and\nsleep. Apply the measure to the years of your life; they have no room for all these things.", "I have been speaking so far of liberal studies; but think how much superfluous and unpractical\nmatter the philosophers contain! Of their own accord they also have descended to establishing nice\ndivisions of syllables, to determining the true meaning of conjunctions and prepositions; they have\nbeen envious of the scholars, envious of the mathematicians. They have taken over into their own\nart all the superfluities of these other arts; the result is that they know more about careful speaking\nthan about careful living. Let me tell you what evils are due to over-nice exactness, and what an\nenemy it is of truth! Protagoras declares that one can take either side on any question and debate it\nwith equal success ? even on this very question, whether every subject can be debated from either\npoint of view. Nausiphanes holds that in things which seem to exist, there is no difference between\nexistence and non-existence. Parmenides maintains that nothing exists of all this which seems to\nexist, except the universe alone. Zeno of Elea removed all the difficulties by removing one; for he\ndeclares that nothing exists. The Pyrrhonean, Megarian, Eretrian, and Academic schools are all\nengaged in practically the same task; they have introduced a new knowledge, non-knowledge. You\nmay sweep all these theories in with the superfluous troops of \"liberal\" studies; the one class of men\ngive me a knowledge that will be of no use to me, the other class do away with any hope of attaining\nknowledge. It is better, of course, to know useless things than to know nothing. One set of\nphilosophers offers no light by which I may direct my gaze toward the truth; the other digs out my\nvery eyes and leaves me blind. If I cleave to Protagoras, there is nothing in the scheme of nature\nthat is not doubtful; if I hold with Nausiphanes, I am sure only of this ? that everything is unsure; if\nwith Parmenides, there is nothing except the One; if with Zeno, there is not even the One.", "What are we, then? What becomes of all these things that surround us, support us, sustain us? The\nwhole universe is then a vain or deceptive shadow. I cannot readily say whether I am more vexed at\nthose who would have it that we know nothing, or with those who would not leave us even this\nprivilege. Farewell.", "Nutricem Anchisae, nomen patriamque novercaeAnchemoli, dicat quot Acestes vixerit annis, etc.,", "It is a useful fact that you wish to know, one which is essential to him who hastens after wisdom ?\nnamely, the parts of philosophy and the division of its huge bulk into separate members. For by\nstudying the parts we can be brought more easily to understand the whole. I only wish that\nphilosophy might come before our eyes in all her unity, just as the whole expanse of the firmament\nis spread out for us to gaze upon! It would be a sight closely resembling that of the firmament. For\nthen surely philosophy would ravish all mortals with love for her; we should abandon all those things\nwhich, in our ignorance of what is great, we believe to be great. Inasmuch, however, as this cannot\nfall to our lot, we must view philosophy just as men gaze upon the secrets of the firmament.", "What kind of things those are which appear good to the many, we may learn even from this. For if\nany man should conceive certain things as being really good, such as prudence, temperance,\njustice, fortitude, he would not after having first conceived these endure to listen to anything which\nshould not be in harmony with what is really good. But if a man has first conceived as good the\nthings which appear to the many to be good, he will listen and readily receive as very applicable that\nwhich was said by the comic writer. Thus even the many perceive the difference. For were it not so,\nthis saying would not offend and would not be rejected in the first case, while we receive it when it is\nsaid of wealth, and of the means which further luxury and fame, as said fitly and wittily. Go on then\nand ask if we should value and think those things to be good, to which after their first conception in\nthe mind the words of the comic writer might be aptly applied- that he who has them, through pure\nabundance has not a place to ease himself in.", "The wise man's mind, to be sure, embraces the whole framework of philosophy, surveying it with no\nless rapid glance than our mortal eyes survey the heavens; we, however, who must break through\nthe gloom, we whose vision fails even for that which is near at hand, can be shown with greater\nease each separate object even though we cannot yet comprehend the universe. I shall therefore\ncomply with your demand, and shall divide philosophy into parts, but not into scraps. For it is useful\nthat philosophy should be divided, but not chopped into bits. Just as it is hard to take in what is\nindefinitely large, so it is hard to take in what is indefinitely small. The people are divided into tribes,\nthe army into centuries. Whatever has grown to greater size is more easily identified if it is broken up\ninto parts; but the parts, as I have remarked, must not be countless in number and diminutive in\nsize. For over-analysis is faulty in precisely the same way as no analysis at all; whatever you cut so\nfine that it becomes dust is as good as blended into a mass again.", "In the first place, therefore, if you approve, I shall draw the distinction between wisdom and\nphilosophy. Wisdom is the perfect good of the human mind; philosophy is the love of wisdom, and\nthe endeavour to attain it. The latter strives toward the goal which the former has already reached.\nAnd it is clear why philosophy was so called. For it acknowledges by its very name the object of its\nlove. Certain persons have defined wisdom as the knowledge of things divine and things human.\nStill others say: \"Wisdom is knowing things divine and things human, and their causes also.\" This\nadded phrase seems to me to be superfluous, since the causes of things divine and things human\nare a part of the divine system. Philosophy also has been defined in various ways; some have called\nit \"the study of virtue,\" others have referred to it as \"a study of the way to amend the mind,\" and\nsome have named it \"the search for right reason.\" One thing is practically settled, that there is some\ndifference between philosophy and wisdom. Nor indeed is it possible that that which is sought and\nthat which seeks are identical. As there is a great difference between avarice and wealth, the one\nbeing the subject of the craving and the other its object, so between philosophy and wisdom. For the\none is a result and a reward of the other. Philosophy does the going, and wisdom is the goal.\nWisdom is that which the Greeks call ?????. The Romans also were wont to use this word in the\nsense in which they now use \"philosophy\" also. This will be proved to your satisfaction by our old\nnational plays, as well as by the epitaph that is carved on the tomb of Dossennus:", "Pause, stranger, and read the wisdom of Dossennus.\nCertain of our school, however, although philosophy meant to them \"the study of virtue,\" and though\nvirtue was the object sought and philosophy the seeker, have maintained nevertheless that the two\ncannot be sundered. For philosophy cannot exist without virtue, nor virtue without philosophy.\nPhilosophy is the study of virtue, by means, however, of virtue itself; but neither can virtue exist\nwithout the study of itself, nor can the study of virtue exist without virtue itself. For it is not like trying\nto hit a target at long range, where the shooter and the object to be shot at are in different places.\nNor, as roads which lead into a city, are the approaches to virtue situated outside virtue herself; the\npath by which one reaches virtue leads by way of virtue herself; philosophy and virtue cling closely\ntogether.", "The greatest authors, and the greatest number of authors, have maintained that there are three\ndivisions of philosophy ? moral, natural, and rational. The first keeps the soul in order; the second\ninvestigates the universe; the third works out the essential meanings of words, their combinations,\nand the proofs which keep falsehood from creeping in and displacing truth. But there have also been\nthose who divided philosophy on the one hand into fewer divisions, on the other hand into more.\nCertain of the Peripatetic school have added a fourth division, \"civil philosophy,\" because it calls for\na special sphere of activity and is interested in a different subject matter. Some have added a\ndepartment for which they use the Greek term \"economics,\" the science of managing one's own\nhousehold. Still others have made a distinct heading for the various kinds of life. There is no one of\nthese subdivisions, however, which will not be found under the branch called \"moral\" philosophy.", "The Epicureans held that philosophy was twofold, natural and moral; they did away with the rational\nbranch. Then, when they were compelled by the facts themselves to distinguish between equivocal\nideas and to expose fallacies that lay hidden under the cloak of truth, they themselves also\nintroduced a heading to which they give the name \"forensic and regulative,\" which is merely\n\"rational\" under another name, although they hold that this section is accessory to the department of\n\"natural\" philosophy. The Cyrenaic school abolished the natural as well as the rational department,\nand were content with the moral side alone; and yet these philosophers also include under another\ntitle that which they have rejected. For they divide moral philosophy into five parts: (What to avoid\nand what to seek, (The Passions, (Actions, (Causes, (Proofs. Now the causes of things really belong\nto the \"natural\" division, the proofs to the \"rational.\" Aristo of Chios remarked that the natural and the\nrational were not only superfluous, but were also contradictory. He even limited the \"moral,\" which\nwas all that was left to him; for he abolished that heading which embraced advice, maintaining that it\nwas the business of the pedagogue, and not of the philosopher ? as if the wise man were anything\nelse than the pedagogue of the human race!", "Since, therefore, philosophy is threefold, let us first begin to set in order the moral side. It has been\nagreed that this should be divided into three parts. First, we have the speculative part, which\nassigns to each thing its particular function and weighs the worth of each; it is highest in point of\nutility. For what is so indispensable as giving to everything its proper value? The second has to do\nwith impulse, the third with actions. For the first duty is to determine severally what things are worth;\nthe second, to conceive with regard to them a regulated and ordered impulse; the third, to make\nyour impulse and your actions harmonize, so that under all these conditions you may be consistent\nwith yourself. If any of these three be defective, there is confusion in the rest also. For what benefit\nis there in having all things appraised, each in its proper relations, if you go to excess in your\nimpulses? What benefit is there in having checked your impulses and in having your desires in your\nown control, if when you come to action you are unaware of the proper times and seasons, and if\nyou do not know when, where, and how each action should be carried out? It is one thing to\nunderstand the merits and the values of facts, another thing to know the precise moment for action,\nand still another to curb impulses and to proceed, instead of rushing, toward what is to be done.\nHence life is in harmony with itself only when action has not deserted impulse, and when impulse\ntoward an object arises in each case from the worth of the object, being languid or more eager as\nthe case may be, according as the objects which arouse it are worth seeking.", "The natural side of philosophy is twofold: bodily and non-bodily. Each is divided into its own grades\nof importance, so to speak. The topic concerning bodies deals, first, with these two grades: the\ncreative and the created; and the created things are the elements. Now this very topic of the\nelements, as some writers hold, is integral; as others hold, it is divided into matter, the cause which\nmoves all things, and the elements.", "It remains for me to divide rational philosophy into its parts. Now all speech is either continuous, or\nsplit up between questioner and answerer. It has been agreed upon that the former should be called\nrhetoric, and the latter dialectic. Rhetoric deals with words, and meanings, and arrangement.\nDialectic is divided into two parts: words and their meanings, that is, into things which are said, and\nthe words in which they are said. Then comes a subdivision of each ? and it is of vast extent.\nTherefore I shall stop at this point, and", "for if I should take a fancy to give the subdivisions, my letter would become a debater's handbook! I\nam not trying to discourage you, excellent Lucilius, from reading on this subject, provided only that\nyou promptly relate to conduct all that you have read.", "It is your conduct that you must hold in check; you must rouse what is languid in you, bind fast what\nhas become relaxed, conquer what is obstinate, persecute your appetites, and the appetites of\nmankind, as much as you can; and to those who say: \"How long will this unending talk go on?\"\nanswer with the words: \"I ought to be asking you 'How long will these unending sins of yours go\non?'\" Do you really desire my remedies to stop before your vices? But I shall speak of my remedies\nall the more, and just because you offer objections I shall keep on talking. Medicine begins to do\ngood at the time when a touch makes the diseased body tingle with pain. I shall utter words that will\nhelp men even against their will. At times you should allow words other than compliments to reach\nyour ears, and because as individuals you are unwilling to hear the truth, hear it collectively. How far\nwill you extend the boundaries of your estates? An estate which held a nation is too narrow for a\nsingle lord. How far will you push forward your ploughed fields ? you who are not content to confine\nthe measure of your farms even within the amplitude of provinces? You have noble rivers flowing\ndown through your private grounds; you have mighty streams ? boundaries of mighty nations ?\nunder your dominion from source to outlet. This also is too little for you unless you also surround\nwhole seas with your estates, unless your steward holds sway on the other side of the Adriatic, the\nIonian, and the Aegean seas, unless the islands, homes of famous chieftains, are reckoned by you\nas the most paltry of possessions!

And by consequence of such a change I too exist, and those who begot me, and\nso on for ever in the other direction. For nothing hinders us from saying so, even if the universe is\nadministered according to definite periods of revolution.", "And now for a word with you, whose luxury spreads itself out as widely as the greed of those to\nwhom I have just referred.

Wherever the shore shall bend into a bay, there will you\nstraightway be laying foundations, and, not content with any land that has not been made by art, you\nwill bring the sea within your boundaries. On every side let your house-tops flash in the sun, now set\non mountain peaks where they command an extensive outlook over sea and land, now lifted from\nthe plain to the height of mountains; build your manifold structures, your huge piles, ? you are\nnevertheless but individuals, and puny ones at that!

Farewell.", "Who can doubt, my dear Lucilius, that life is the gift of the immortal gods, but that living well is the\ngift of philosophy? Hence the idea that our debt to philosophy is greater than our debt to the gods, in\nproportion as a good life is more of a benefit than mere life, would be regarded as correct, were not\nphilosophy itself a boon which the gods have bestowed upon us. They have given the knowledge\nthereof to none, but the faculty of acquiring it they have given to all. For if they had made philosophy\nalso a general good, and if we were gifted with understanding at our birth, wisdom would have lost\nher best attribute ? that she is not one of the gifts of fortune. For as it is, the precious and noble\ncharacteristic of wisdom is that she does not advance to meet us, that each man is indebted to\nhimself for her, and that we do not seek her at the hands of others.", "What would there be in philosophy worthy of your respect, if she were a thing that came by bounty?\nHer sole function is to discover the truth about things divine and things human. From her side\nreligion never departs, nor duty, nor justice, nor any of the whole company of virtues which cling\ntogether in close-united fellowship. Philosophy has taught us to worship that which is divine, to love\nthat which is human; she has told us that with the gods lies dominion, and among men, fellowship.\nThis fellowship remained unspoiled for a long time, until avarice tore the community asunder and\nbecame the cause of poverty, even in the case of those whom she herself had most enriched. For\nmen cease to possess all things the moment they desire all things for their own.", "But the first men and those who sprang from them, still unspoiled, followed nature, having one man\nas both their leader and their law, entrusting themselves to the control of one better than\nthemselves. For nature has the habit of subjecting the weaker to the stronger. Even among the\ndumb animals those which are either biggest or fiercest hold sway. It is no weakling bull that leads\nthe herd; it is one that has beaten the other males by his might and his muscle. In the case of\nelephants, the tallest goes first; among men, the best is regarded as the highest. That is why it was\nto the mind that a ruler was assigned; and for that reason the greatest happiness rested with those\npeoples among whom a man could not be the more powerful unless he were the better. For that\nman can safely accomplish what he will who thinks he can do nothing except what he ought to do.", "Accordingly, in that age which is maintained to be the golden age, Posidonius holds that the\ngovernment was under the jurisdiction of the wise. They kept their hands under control, and\nprotected the weaker from the stronger. They gave advice, both to do and not to do; they showed\nwhat was useful and what was useless. Their forethought provided that their subjects should lack\nnothing; their bravery warded off dangers; their kindness enriched and adorned their subjects. For\nthem ruling was a service, not an exercise of royalty. No ruler tried his power against those to whom\nhe owed the beginnings of his power; and no one had the inclination, or the excuse, to do wrong,\nsince the ruler ruled well and the subject obeyed well, and the king could utter no greater threat\nagainst disobedient subjects than that they should depart from the kingdom.", "But when once vice stole in and kingdoms were transformed into tyrannies, a need arose for laws;\nand these very laws were in turn framed by the wise. Solon, who established Athens upon a firm\nbasis by just laws, was one of the seven men renowned for their wisdom. Had Lycurgus lived in the\nsame period, an eighth would have been added to that hallowed number seven. The laws of\nZaleucus and Charondas are praised; it was not in the forum or in the offices of skilled counsellors,\nbut in the silent and holy retreat of Pythagoras, that these two men learned the principles of justice\nwhich they were to establish in Sicily (which at that time was prosperous) and throughout Grecian\nItaly.", "Up to this point I agree with Posidonius; but that philosophy discovered the arts of which life makes\nuse in its daily round I refuse to admit, nor will I ascribe to it an artisan's glory. Posidonius says:\n\"When men were scattered over the earth, protected by caves or by the dug-out shelter of a cliff or\nby the trunk of a hollow tree, it was philosophy that taught them to build houses.\" But I, for my part,\ndo not hold that philosophy devised these shrewdly-contrived dwellings of ours which rise story upon\nstory, where city crowds against city, any more than that she invented the fish-preserves, which are\nenclosed for the purpose of saving men's gluttony from having to run the risk of storms, and in order\nthat, no matter how wildly the sea is raging, luxury may have its safe harbours in which to fatten\nfancy breeds of fish. What! Was it philosophy that taught the use of keys and bolts? Nay, what was\nthat except giving a hint to avarice? Was it philosophy that erected all these towering tenements, so\ndangerous to the persons who dwell in them? Was it not enough for man to provide himself a roof of\nany chance covering, and to contrive for himself some natural retreat without the help of art and\nwithout trouble? Believe me, that was a happy age, before the days of architects, before the days of\nbuilders! All this sort of thing was born when luxury was being born, ? this matter of cutting timbers\nsquare and cleaving a beam with unerring hand as the saw made its way over the marked-out line.", "For they were not preparing a roof for a future banquet-ball; for no such use did they carry the\npine-trees or the firs along the trembling streets with a long row of drays ? merely to fasten thereon\npanelled ceilings heavy with gold. Forked poles erected at either end propped up their houses. With\nclose-packed branches and with leaves heaped up and laid sloping they contrived a drainage for\neven the heaviest rains. Beneath such dwellings, they lived, but they lived in peace. A thatched roof\nonce covered free men; under marble and gold dwells slavery.", "From Catulus, not to be indifferent when a friend finds fault, even if he should find fault without\nreason, but to try to restore him to his usual disposition; and to be ready to speak well of teachers,\nas it is reported of Domitius and Athenodotus; and to love my children truly.", "Reason and the reasoning art (philosophy) are powers which are sufficient for themselves and for\ntheir own works. They move then from a first principle which is their own, and they make their way to\nthe end which is proposed to them; and this is the reason why such acts are named catorthoseis or\nright acts, which word signifies that they proceed by the right road.", "On another point also I differ from Posidonius, when he holds that mechanical tools were the\ninvention of wise men. For on that basis one might maintain that those were wise who taught the\narts", "It was man's ingenuity, not his wisdom, that discovered all these devices. And I also differ from him\nwhen he says that wise men discovered our mines of iron and copper, \"when the earth, scorched by\nforest fires, melted the veins of ore which lay near the surface and caused the metal to gush forth.\"\nNay, the sort of men who discover such things are the sort of men who are busied with them. Nor do\nI consider this question so subtle as Posidonius thinks, namely, whether the hammer or the tongs\ncame first into use. They were both invented by some man whose mind was nimble and keen, but\nnot great or exalted; and the same holds true of any other discovery which can only be made by\nmeans of a bent body and of a mind whose gaze is upon the ground.", "The wise man was easy-going in his way of living. And why not? Even in our own times he would\nprefer to be as little cumbered as possible. How, I ask, can you consistently admire both Diogenes\nand Daedalus? Which of these two seems to you a wise man ? the one who devised the saw, or the\none who, on seeing a boy drink water from the hollow of his hand, forthwith took his cup from his\nwallet and broke it, upbraiding himself with these words: \"Fool that I am, to have been carrying\nsuperfluous baggage all this time!\" and then curled himself up in his tub and lay down to sleep? In\nthese our own times, which man, pray, do you deem the wiser ? the one who invents a process for\nspraying saffron perfumes to a tremendous height from hidden pipes, who fills or empties canals by\na sudden rush of waters, who so cleverly constructs a dining-room with a ceiling of movable panels\nthat it presents one pattern after another, the roof changing as often as the courses, ? or the one\nwho proves to others, as well as to himself, that nature has laid upon us no stern and difficult law\nwhen she tells us that we can live without the marble-cutter and the engineer, that we can clothe\nourselves without traffic in silk fabrics, that we can have everything that is indispensable to our use,\nprovided only that we are content with what the earth has placed on its surface? If mankind were\nwilling to listen to this sage, they would know that the cook is as superfluous to them as the soldier.\nThose were wise men, or at any rate like the wise, who found the care of the body a problem easy\nto solve. The things that are indispensable require no elaborate pains for their acquisition; it is only\nthe luxuries that call for labour. Follow nature, and you will need no skilled craftsmen.", "Nature did not wish us to be harassed. For whatever she forced upon us, she equipped us. \"But cold\ncannot be endured by the naked body.\" What then? Are there not the skins of wild beasts and other\nanimals, which can protect us well enough, and more than enough, from the cold? Do not many\ntribes cover their bodies with the bark of trees? Are not the feathers of birds sewn together to serve\nfor clothing? Even at the present day does not a large portion of the Scythian tribe garb itself in the\nskins of foxes and mice, soft to the touch and impervious to the winds? \"For all that, men must have\nsome thicker protection than the skin, in order to keep off the heat of the sun in summer.\" What\nthen? Has not antiquity produced many retreats which, hollowed out either by the damage wrought\nby time or by any other occurrence you will, have opened into caverns? What then? Did not the very\nfirst-comers take twigs and weave them by hand into wicker mats, smear them with common mud,\nand then with stubble and other wild grasses construct a roof, and thus pass their winters secure,\nthe rains carried off by means of the sloping gables? What then? Do not the peoples on the edge of\nthe Syrtes dwell in dug-out houses ? and indeed all the tribes who, because of the too fierce blaze\nof the sun, possess no protection sufficient to keep off the heat except the parched soil itself?", "Nature was not so hostile to man that, when she gave all the other animals an easy r\u00f4le in life, she\nmade it impossible for him alone to live without all these artifices. None of these was imposed upon\nus by her; none of them had to be painfully sought out that our lives might be prolonged. All things\nwere ready for us at our birth; it is we that have made everything difficult for ourselves, through our\ndisdain for what is easy. Houses, shelter, creature comforts, food, and all that has now become the\nsource of vast trouble, were ready at hand, free to all, and obtainable for trifling pains. For the limit\neverywhere corresponded to the need; it is we that have made all those things valuable, we that\nhave made them admired, we that have caused them to be sought for by extensive and manifold\ndevices. Nature suffices for what she demands. Luxury has turned her back upon nature; each day\nshe expands herself, in all the ages she has been gathering strength, and by her wit promoting the\nvices. At first, luxury began to lust for what nature regarded as superfluous, then for that which was\ncontrary to nature; and finally she made the soul a bondsman to the body, and bade it be an utter\nslave to the body's lusts. All these crafts by which the city is patrolled ? or shall I say kept in uproar ?\nare but engaged in the body's business; time was when all things were offered to the body as to a\nslave, but now they are made ready for it as for a master. Accordingly, hence have come the\nworkshops of the weavers and the carpenters; hence the savoury smells of the professional cooks;\nhence the wantonness of those who teach wanton postures, and wanton and affected singing. For\nthat moderation which nature prescribes, which limits our desires by resources restricted to our\nneeds, has abandoned the field; it has now come to this ? that to want only what is enough is a sign\nboth of boorishness and of utter destitution.", "It is hard to believe, my dear Lucilius, how easily the charm of eloquence wins even great men away\nfrom the truth. Take, for example, Posidonius ? who, in my estimation, is of the number of those who\nhave contributed most to philosophy ? when he wishes to describe the art of weaving. He tells how,\nfirst, some threads are twisted and some drawn out from the soft, loose mass of wool; next, how the\nupright warp keeps the threads stretched by means of hanging weights; then, how the inserted\nthread of the woof, which softens the hard texture of the web which holds it fast on either side, is\nforced by the batten to make a compact union with the warp. He maintains that even the weaver's\nart was discovered by wise men, forgetting that the more complicated art which he describes was\ninvented in later days ? the art wherein", "The reed doth part the warp. Between the threads\nIs shot the woof by pointed shuttles borne;\nThe broad comb's well-notched teeth then drive it home.", "Suppose he had had the opportunity of seeing the weaving of our own day, which produces the\nclothing that will conceal nothing, the clothing which affords ? I will not say no protection to the body,\nbut none even to modesty!", "None of these things ought to be called a man's, which do not belong to a man, as man. They are\nnot required of a man, nor does man's nature promise them, nor are they the means of man's nature\nattaining its end. Neither then does the end of man lie in these things, nor yet that which aids to the\naccomplishment of this end, and that which aids towards this end is that which is good. Besides, if\nany of these things did belong to man, it would not be right for a man to despise them and to set\nhimself against them; nor would a man be worthy of praise who showed that he did not want these\nthings, nor would he who stinted himself in any of them be good, if indeed these things were good.\nBut now the more of these things a man deprives himself of, or of other things like them, or even\nwhen he is deprived of any of them, the more patiently he endures the loss, just in the same degree\nhe is a better man.", "Posidonius then passes on to the farmer. With no less eloquence he describes the ground which is\nbroken up and crossed again by the plough, so that the earth, thus loosened, may allow freer play to\nthe roots; then the seed is sown, and the weeds plucked out by hand, lest any chance growth or wild\nplant spring up and spoil the crop. This trade also, he declares, is the creation of the wise, ? just as\nif cultivators of the soil were not even at the present day discovering countless new methods of\nincreasing the soil's fertility! Furthermore, not confining his attention to these arts, he even degrades\nthe wise man by sending him to the mill. For he tells us how the sage, by imitating the processes of\nnature, began to make bread. \"The grain,\" he says, \"once taken into the mouth, is crushed by the\nflinty teeth, which meet in hostile encounter, and whatever grain slips out the tongue turns back to\nthe selfsame teeth. Then it is blended into a mass, that it may the more easily pass down the\nslippery throat. When this has reached the stomach, it is digested by the stomach's equable heat;\nthen, and not till then, it is assimilated with the body. Following this pattern,\" he goes on, \"someone\nplaced two rough stones, the one above the other, in imitation of the teeth, one set of which is\nstationary and awaits the motion of the other set. Then, by the rubbing of the one stone against the\nother, the grain is crushed and brought back again and again, until by frequent rubbing it is reduced\nto powder. Then this man sprinkled the meal with water, and by continued manipulation subdued the\nmass and moulded the loaf. This loaf was, at first, baked by hot ashes or by an earthen vessel\nglowing hot; later on ovens were gradually discovered and the other devices whose heat will render\nobedience to the sage's will.\" Posidonius came very near declaring that even the cobbler's trade\nwas the discovery of the wise man.", "Reason did indeed devise all these things, but it was not right reason. It was man, but not the wise\nman, that discovered them; just as they invented ships, in which we cross rivers and seas ? ships\nfitted with sails for the purpose of catching the force of the winds, ships with rudders added at the\nstern in order to turn the vessel's course in one direction or another. The model followed was the\nfish, which steers itself by its tail, and by its slightest motion on this side or on that bends its swift\ncourse. \"But,\" says Posidonius, \"the wise man did indeed discover all these things; they were,\nhowever, too petty for him to deal with himself and so he entrusted them to his meaner assistants.\"\nNot so; these early inventions were thought out by no other class of men than those who have them\nin charge to-day. We know that certain devices have come to light only within our own memory ?\nsuch as the use of windows which admit the clear light through transparent tiles, and such as the\nvaulted baths, with pipes let into their walls for the purpose of diffusing the heat which maintains an\neven temperature in their lowest as well as in their highest spaces. Why need I mention the marble\nwith which our temples and our private houses are resplendent? Or the rounded and polished\nmasses of stone by means of which we erect colonnades and buildings roomy enough for nations?\nOr our signs for whole words, which enable us to take down a speech, however rapidly uttered,\nmatching speed of tongue by speed of hand? All this sort of thing has been devised by the lowest\ngrade of slaves. Wisdom's seat is higher; she trains not the hands, but is mistress of our minds.", "Would you know what wisdom has brought forth to light, what she has accomplished? It is not the\ngraceful poses of the body, or the varied notes produced by horn and flute, whereby the breath is\nreceived and, as it passes out or through, is transformed into voice. It is not wisdom that contrives\narms, or walls, or instruments useful in war; nay, her voice is for peace, and she summons all\nmankind to concord. It is not she, I maintain, who is the artisan of our indispensable implements of\ndaily use. Why do you assign to her such petty things? You see in her the skilled artisan of life. The\nother arts, it is true, wisdom has under her control; for he whom life serves is also served by the\nthings which equip life. But wisdom's course is toward the state of happiness; thither she guides us,\nthither she opens the way for us. She shows us what things are evil and what things are seemingly\nevil; she strips our minds of vain illusion. She bestows upon us a greatness which is substantial, but\nshe represses the greatness which is inflated, and showy but filled with emptiness; and she does\nnot permit us to be ignorant of the difference between what is great and what is but swollen; nay,\nshe delivers to us the knowledge of the whole of nature and of her own nature. She discloses to us\nwhat the gods are and of what sort they are; what are the nether gods, the household deities, and\nthe protecting spirits; what are the souls which have been endowed with lasting life and have been\nadmitted to the second class of divinities, where is their abode and what their activities, powers, and\nwill.", "Such are wisdom's rites of initiation, by means of which is unlocked, not a village shrine, but the vast\ntemple of all the gods ? the universe itself, whose true apparitions and true aspects she offers to the\ngaze of our minds. For the vision of our eyes is too dull for sights so great. Then she goes back to\nthe beginnings of things, to the eternal Reason which was imparted to the whole, and to the force\nwhich inheres in all the seeds of things, giving them the power to fashion each thing according to its\nkind. Then wisdom begins to inquire about the soul, whence it comes, where it dwells, how long it\nabides, into how many divisions it falls. Finally, she has turned her attention from the corporeal to\nthe incorporeal, and has closely examined truth and the marks whereby truth is known, inquiring\nnext how that which is equivocal can be distinguished from the truth, whether in life or in language;\nfor in both are elements of the false mingled with the true.", "It is my opinion that the wise man has not withdrawn himself, as Posidonius thinks, from those arts\nwhich we were discussing, but that he never took them up at all. For he would have judged that\nnothing was worth discovering that he would not afterwards judge to be worth using always. He\nwould not take up things which would have to be laid aside.", "\"But Anacharsis,\" says Posidonius, \"invented the potter's wheel, whose whirling gives shape to\nvessels.\" Then because the potter's wheel is mentioned in Homer, people prefer to believe that\nHomer's verses are false rather than the story of Posidonius! But I maintain that Anacharsis was not\nthe creator of this wheel; and even if he was, although he was a wise man when he invented it, yet\nhe did not invent it qua \"wise man\" ? just as there are a great many things which wise men do as\nmen, not as wise men. Suppose, for example, that a wise man is exceedingly fleet of foot; he will\noutstrip all the runners in the race by virtue of being fleet, not by virtue of his wisdom. I should like to\nshow Posidonius some glass-blower who by his breath moulds the glass into manifold shapes which\ncould scarcely be fashioned by the most skilful hand. Nay, these discoveries have been made since\nwe men have ceased to discover wisdom.", "But Posidonius again remarks: \"Democritus is said to have discovered the arch, whose effect was\nthat the curving line of stones, which gradually lean toward each other, is bound together by the\nkeystone.\" I am inclined to pronounce this statement false. For there must have been, before\nDemocritus, bridges and gateways in which the curvature did not begin until about the top. It seems\nto have quite slipped your memory that this same Democritus discovered how ivory could be\nsoftened, how, by boiling, a pebble could be transformed into an emerald, ? the same process used\neven to-day for colouring stones which are found to be amenable to this treatment! It may have\nbeen a wise man who discovered all such things, but he did not discover them by virtue of being a\nwise man; for he does many things which we see done just as well, or even more skilfully and\ndexterously, by men who are utterly lacking in sagacity.", "Do you ask what, then, the wise man has found out and what he has brought to light? First of all\nthere is truth, and nature; and nature he has not followed as the other animals do, with eyes too dull\nto perceive the divine in it. In the second place, there is the law of life, and life he has made to\nconform to universal principles; and he has taught us, not merely to know the gods, but to follow\nthem, and to welcome the gifts of chance precisely as if they were divine commands. He has\nforbidden us to give heed to false opinions, and has weighed the value of each thing by a true\nstandard of appraisement. He has condemned those pleasures with which remorse is intermingled,\nand has praised those goods which will always satisfy; and he has published the truth abroad that\nhe is most happy who has no need of happiness, and that he is most powerful who has power over\nhimself.", "I am not speaking of that philosophy which has placed the citizen outside his country and the gods\noutside the universe, and which has bestowed virtue upon pleasure, but rather of that philosophy\nwhich counts nothing good except what is honourable, ? one which cannot be cajoled by the gifts\neither of man or of fortune, one whose value is that it cannot be bought for any value. That this\nphilosophy existed in such a rude age, when the arts and crafts were still unknown and when useful\nthings could only be learned by use, ? this I refuse to believe.", "Next there came the fortune-favoured period when the bounties of nature lay open to all, for men's\nindiscriminate use, before avarice and luxury had broken the bonds which held mortals together,\nand they, abandoning their communal existence, had separated and turned to plunder. The men of\nthe second age were not wise men, even though they did what wise men should do. Indeed, there is\nno other condition of the human race that anyone would regard more highly; and if God should\ncommission a man to fashion earthly creatures and to bestow institutions upon peoples, this man\nwould approve of no other system than that which obtained among the men of that age, when", "Such as are thy habitual thoughts, such also will be the character of thy mind; for the soul is dyed by\nthe thoughts. Dye it then with a continuous series of such thoughts as these: for instance, that\nwhere a man can live, there he can also live well. But he must live in a palace;- well then, he can\nalso live well in a palace. And again, consider that for whatever purpose each thing has been\nconstituted, for this it has been constituted, and towards this it is carried; and its end is in that\ntowards which it is carried; and where the end is, there also is the advantage and the good of each\nthing. Now the good for the reasonable animal is society; for that we are made for society has been\nshown above. Is it not plain that the inferior exist for the sake of the superior? But the things which\nhave life are superior to those which have not life, and of those which have life the superior are\nthose which have reason.", "To portion off or bound one's property.\nMen shared their gains, and earth more freely gave\nHer riches to her sons who sought them not.", "What race of men was ever more blest than that race? They enjoyed all nature in partnership.\nNature sufficed for them, now the guardian, as before she was the parent, of all; and this her gift\nconsisted of the assured possession by each man of the common resources. Why should I not even\ncall that race the richest among mortals, since you could not find a poor person among them?", "But avarice broke in upon a condition so happily ordained, and, by its eagerness to lay something\naway and to turn it to its own private use, made all things the property of others, and reduced itself\nfrom boundless wealth to straitened need. It was avarice that introduced poverty and, by craving\nmuch, lost all. And so, although she now tries to make good her loss, although she adds one estate\nto another, evicting a neighbour either by buying him out or by wronging him, although she extends\nher country-seats to the size of provinces and defines ownership as meaning extensive travel\nthrough one's own property, ? in spite of all these efforts of hers, no enlargement of our boundaries\nwill bring us back to the condition from which we have departed.", "When there is no more that we can do, we shall possess much; but we once possessed the whole\nworld! The very soil was more productive when untilled, and yielded more than enough for peoples\nwho refrained from despoiling one another. Whatever gift nature had produced, men found as much\npleasure in revealing it to another as in having discovered it. It was possible for no man either to\nsurpass another or to fall short of him; what there was, was divided among unquarrelling friends. Not\nyet had the stronger begun to lay hands upon the weaker; not yet had the miser, by hiding away\nwhat lay before him, begun to shut off his neighbour from even the necessities of life; each cared as\nmuch for his neighbour as for himself. Armour lay unused, and the hand, unstained by human blood,\nhad turned all its hatred against wild beasts. The men of that day, who had found in some dense\ngrove protection against the sun, and security against the severity of winter or of rain in their mean\nhiding-places, spent their lives under the branches of the trees and passed tranquil nights without a\nsigh. Care vexes us in our purple, and routs us from our beds with the sharpest of goads; but how\nsoft was the sleep the hard earth bestowed upon the men of that day! No fretted and panelled\nceilings hung over them, but as they lay beneath the open sky the stars glided quietly above them,\nand the firmament, night's noble pageant, marched swiftly by, conducting its mighty task in silence.\nFor them by day, as well as by night, the visions of this most glorious abode were free and open. It\nwas their joy to watch the constellations as they sank from mid-heaven, and others, again, as they\nrose from their hidden abodes. What else but joy could it be to wander among the marvels which\ndotted the heavens far and wide? But you of the present day shudder at every sound your houses\nmake, and as you sit among your frescoes the slightest creak makes you shrink in terror. They had\nno houses as big as cities. The air, the breezes blowing free through the open spaces, the flitting\nshade of crag or tree, springs crystal-clear and streams not spoiled by man's work, whether by\nwater-pipe or by any confinement of the channel, but running at will, and meadows beautiful without\nthe use of art, ? amid such scenes were their rude homes, adorned with rustic hand. Such a\ndwelling was in accordance with nature; therein it was a joy to live, fearing neither the dwelling itself\nnor for its safety. In these days, however, our houses constitute a large portion of our dread.", "But no matter how excellent and guileless was the life of the men of that age, they were not wise\nmen; for that title is reserved for the highest achievement. Still, I would not deny that they were men\nof lofty spirit and ? I may use the phrase ? fresh from the gods. For there is no doubt that the world\nproduced a better progeny before it was yet worn out. However, not all were endowed with mental\nfaculties of highest perfection, though in all cases their native powers were more sturdy than ours\nand more fitted for toil. For nature does not bestow virtue; it is an art to become good. They, at least,\nsearched not in the lowest dregs of the earth for gold, nor yet for silver or transparent stones; and\nthey still were merciful even to the dumb animals ? so far removed was that epoch from the custom\nof slaying man by man, not in anger or through fear, but just to make a show! They had as yet no\nembroidered garments nor did they weave cloth of gold; gold was not yet even mined.", "What, then, is the conclusion of the matter? It was by reason of their ignorance of things that the\nmen of those days were innocent; and it makes a great deal of difference whether one wills not to\nsin or has not the knowledge to sin. Justice was unknown to them, unknown prudence, unknown\nalso self-control and bravery; but their rude life possessed certain qualities akin to all these virtues.\nVirtue is not vouchsafed to a soul unless that soul has been trained and taught, and by unremitting\npractice brought to perfection. For the attainment of this boon, but not in the possession of it, were\nwe born; and even in the best of men, before you refine them by instruction, there is but the stuff of\nvirtue, not virtue itself. Farewell.", "Serraco veniente abies, atque altera pinum\nPlaustra vehunt, nutant alte populoque minantur.", "To seek what is impossible is madness: and it is impossible that the bad should not do something of\nthis kind.", "Our friend Liberalis is now downcast; for he has just heard of the fire which has wiped out the colony\nof Lyons. Such a calamity might upset anyone at all, not to speak of a man who dearly loves his\ncountry. But this incident has served to make him inquire about the strength of his own character,\nwhich he has trained, I suppose, just to meet situations that he thought might cause him fear. I do\nnot wonder, however, that he was free from apprehension touching an evil so unexpected and\npractically unheard of as this, since it is without precedent. For fire has damaged many a city, but\nhas annihilated none. Even when fire has been hurled against the walls by the hand of a foe, the\nflame dies out in many places, and although continually renewed, rarely devours so wholly as to\nleave nothing for the sword. Even an earthquake has scarcely ever been so violent and destructive\nas to overthrow whole cities. Finally, no conflagration has ever before blazed forth so savagely in\nany town that nothing was left for a second. So many beautiful buildings, any single one of which\nwould make a single town famous, were wrecked in one night. In time of such deep peace an event\nhas taken place worse than men can possibly fear even in time of war. Who can believe it? When\nweapons are everywhere at rest, and when peace prevails throughout the world, Lyons, the pride of\nGaul, is missing!", "Fortune has usually allowed all men, when she has assailed them collectively, to have a foreboding\nof that which they were destined to suffer. Every great creation has had granted to it a period of\nreprieve before its fall; but in this case, only a single night elapsed between the city at its greatest\nand the city non-existent. In short, it takes me longer to tell you it has perished than it took for the\ncity to perish.", "All this has affected our friend Liberalis, bending his will, which is usually so steadfast and erect in\nthe face of his own trials. And not without reason has he been shaken; for it is the unexpected that\nputs the heaviest load upon us. Strangeness adds to the weight of calamities, and every mortal feels\nthe greater pain as a result of that which also brings surprise.", "Therefore, nothing ought to be unexpected by us. Our minds should be sent forward in advance to\nmeet all problems, and we should consider, not what is wont to happen, but what can happen. For\nwhat is there in existence that Fortune, when she has so willed, does not drag down from the very\nheight of its prosperity? And what is there that she does not the more violently assail the more\nbrilliantly it shines? What is laborious or difficult for her? She does not always attack in one way, or\neven with her full strength; at one time she summons our own hands against us; at another time,\ncontent with her own powers, she makes use of no agent in devising perils for us. No time is\nexempt; in the midst of our very pleasures there spring up causes of suffering. War arises in the\nmidst of peace, and that which we depended upon for protection is transformed into a cause of fear;\nfriend becomes enemy, ally becomes foeman. The summer calm is stirred into sudden storms,\nwilder than the storms of winter. With no foe in sight we are victims of such fates as foes inflict, and\nif other causes of disaster fail, excessive good fortune finds them for itself. The most temperate are\nassailed by illness, the strongest by wasting disease, the most innocent by chastisement, the most\nsecluded by the noisy mob.", "Chance chooses some new weapon by which to bring her strength to bear against us, thinking we\nhave forgotten her. Whatever structure has been reared by a long sequence of years, at the cost of\ngreat toil and through the great kindness of the gods, is scattered and dispersed by a single day.\nNay, he who has said \"a day\" has granted too long a postponement to swift-coming misfortune; an\nhour, an instant of time, suffices for the overthrow of empires! It would be some consolation for the\nfeebleness of our selves and our works, if all things should perish as slowly as they come into being;\nbut as it is, increases are of sluggish growth, but the way to ruin is rapid. Nothing, whether public or\nprivate, is stable; the destinies of men, no less than those of cities, are in a whirl. Amid the greatest\ncalm terror arises, and though no external agencies stir up commotion, yet evils burst forth from\nsources whence they were least expected. Thrones which have stood the shock of civil and foreign\nwars crash to the ground though no one sets them tottering. How few the states which have carried\ntheir good fortune through to the end!", "We should therefore reflect upon all contingencies, and should fortify our minds against the evils\nwhich may possibly come. Exile, the torture of disease, wars, shipwreck, ? we must think on these.\nChance may tear you from your country or your country from you, or may banish you to the desert;\nthis very place, where throngs are stifling, may become a desert. Let us place before our eyes in its\nentirety the nature of man's lot, and if we would not be overwhelmed, or even dazed, by those\nunwonted evils, as if they were novel, let us summon to our minds beforehand, not as great an evil\nas oftentimes happens, but the very greatest evil that possibly can happen. We must reflect upon\nfortune fully and completely.", "How often have cities in Asia, how often in Achaia, been laid low by a single shock of earthquake!\nHow many towns in Syria, how many in Macedonia, have been swallowed up! How often has this\nkind of devastation laid Cyprus in ruins! How often has Paphos collapsed! Not infrequently are\ntidings brought to us of the utter destruction of entire cities; yet how small a part of the world are we,\nto whom such tidings often come!", "Let us rise, therefore, to confront the operations of Fortune, and whatever happens, let us have the\nassurance that it is not so great as rumour advertises it to be. A rich city has been laid in ashes, the\njewel of the provinces, counted as one of them and yet not included with them; rich though it was,\nnevertheless it was set upon a single hill, and that not very large in extent. But of all those cities, of\nwhose magnificence and grandeur you hear today, the very traces will be blotted out by time. Do\nyou not see how, in Achaia, the foundations of the most famous cities have already crumbled to\nnothing, so that no trace is left to show that they ever even existed? Not only does that which has\nbeen made with hands totter to the ground, not only is that which has been set in place by man's art\nand man's efforts overthrown by the passing days; nay, the peaks of mountains dissolve, whole\ntracts have settled, and places which once stood far from the sight of the sea are now covered by\nthe waves. The mighty power of fires has eaten away the hills through whose sides they used to\nglow, and has levelled to the ground peaks which were once most lofty ? the sailor's solace and his\nbeacon. The works of nature herself are harassed; hence we ought to bear with untroubled minds\nthe destruction of cities. They stand but to fall! This doom awaits them, one and all; it may be that\nsome internal force, and blasts of violence which are tremendous because their way is blocked, will\nthrow off the weight which holds then down; or that a whirlpool of raging currents, mightier because\nthey are hidden in the bosom of the earth, will break through that which resists its power; or that the\nvehemence of flames will burst asunder the framework of the earth's crust; or that time, from which\nnothing is safe, will reduce them little by little; or that a pestilential climate will drive their inhabitants\naway and the mould will corrode their deserted walls. It would be tedious to recount all the ways by\nwhich fate may come; but this one thing I know: all the works of mortal man have been doomed to\nmortality, and in the midst of things which have been destined to die, we live!", "Nothing happens to any man which he is not formed by nature to bear. The same things happen to\nanother, and either because he does not see that they have happened or because he would show a\ngreat spirit he is firm and remains unharmed. It is a shame then that ignorance and conceit should\nbe stronger than wisdom.", "Hence it is thoughts like these, and of this kind, which I am offering as consolation to our friend\nLiberalis, who burns with a love for his country that is beyond belief. Perhaps its destruction has\nbeen brought about only that it may be raised up again to a better destiny. Oftentimes a reverse has\nbut made room for more prosperous fortune. Many structures have fallen only to rise to a greater\nheight. Timagenes, who had a grudge against Rome and her prosperity, used to say that the only\nreason he was grieved when conflagrations occurred in Rome was his knowledge that better\nbuildings would arise than those which had gone down in the flames. And probably in this city of\nLyons, too, all its citizens will earnestly strive that everything shall be rebuilt better in size and\nsecurity than what they have lost. May it be built to endure and, under happier auspices, for a longer\nexistence! This is indeed but the hundredth year since this colony was founded ? not the limit even\nof a man's lifetime. Led forth by Plancus, the natural advantages of its site have caused it to wax\nstrong and reach the numbers which it contains to-day; and yet how many calamities of the greatest\nseverity has it endured within the space of an old man's life!", "Therefore let the mind be disciplined to understand and to endure its own lot, and let it have the\nknowledge that there is nothing which fortune does not dare ? that she has the same jurisdiction\nover empires as over emperors, the same power over cities as over the citizens who dwell therein.\nWe must not cry out at any of these calamities. Into such a world have we entered, and under such\nlaws do we live. If you like it, obey; if not, depart whithersoever you wish. Cry out in anger if any\nunfair measures are taken with reference to you individually; but if this inevitable law is binding upon\nthe highest and the lowest alike, be reconciled to fate, by which all things are dissolved. You should\nnot estimate our worth by our funeral mounds or by these monuments of unequal size which line the\nroad; their ashes level all men! We are unequal at birth, but are equal in death. What I say about\ncities I say also about their inhabitants: Ardea was captured as well as Rome. The great founder of\nhuman law has not made distinctions between us on the basis of high lineage or of illustrious\nnames, except while we live. When, however, we come to the end which awaits mortals, he says:\n\"Depart, ambition! To all creatures that burden the earth let one and the same law apply!\" For\nenduring all things, we are equal; no one is more frail than another, no one more certain of his own\nlife on the morrow.", "Alexander, king of Macedon, began to study geometry; unhappy man, because he would thereby\nlearn how puny was that earth of which he had seized but a fraction! Unhappy man, I repeat,\nbecause he was bound to understand that he was bearing a false title. For who can be \"great\" in\nthat which is puny? The lessons which were being taught him were intricate and could be learned\nonly by assiduous application; they were not the kind to be comprehended by a madman, who let\nhis thoughts range beyond the ocean. \"Teach me something easy!\" he cries; but his teacher\nanswers: \"These things are the same for all, as hard for one as for another.\" Imagine that nature is\nsaying to us: \"Those things of which you complain are the same for all. I cannot give anything easier\nto any man, but whoever wishes will make things easier for himself.\" In what way? By equanimity.\nYou must suffer pain, and thirst, and hunger, and old age too, if a longer stay among men shall be\ngranted you; you must be sick, and you must suffer loss and death. Nevertheless, you should not\nbelieve those whose noisy clamour surrounds you; none of these things is an evil, none is beyond\nyour power to bear, or is burdensome. It is only by common opinion that there is anything formidable\nin them. Your fearing death is therefore like your fear of gossip. But what is more foolish than a man\nafraid of words? Our friend Demetrius is wont to put it cleverly when he says: \"For me the talk of\nignorant men is like the rumblings which issue from the belly. For,\" he adds, \"what difference does it\nmake to me whether such rumblings come from above or from below?\" What madness it is to be\nafraid of disrepute in the judgment of the disreputable! Just as you have had no cause for shrinking\nin terror from the talk of men, so you have no cause now to shrink from these things, which you\nwould never fear had not their talk forced fear upon you. Does it do any harm to a good man to be\nbesmirched by unjust gossip? Then let not this sort of thing damage death, either, in our estimation;\ndeath also is in bad odour. But no one of those who malign death has made trial of it.", "Meanwhile it is foolhardy to condemn that of which you are ignorant. This one thing, however, you\ndo know ? that death is helpful to many, that it sets many free from tortures, want, ailments,\nsufferings, and weariness. We are in the power of nothing when once we have death in our own\npower! Farewell.", "You and I will agree, I think, that outward things are sought for the satisfaction of the body, that the\nbody is cherished out of regard for the soul, and that in the soul there are certain parts which\nminister to us, enabling us to move and to sustain life, bestowed upon us just for the sake of the\nprimary part of us. In this primary part there is something irrational, and something rational. The\nformer obeys the latter, while the latter is the only thing that is not referred back to another, but\nrather refers all things to itself. For the divine reason also is set in supreme command over all things,\nand is itself subject to none; and even this reason which we possess is the same, because it is\nderived from the divine reason. Now if we are agreed on this point, it is natural that we shall be\nagreed on the following also ? namely, that the happy life depends upon this and this alone: our\nattainment of perfect reason. For it is naught but this that keeps the soul from being bowed down,\nthat stands its ground against Fortune; whatever the condition of their affairs may be, it keeps men\nuntroubled. And that alone is a good which is never subject to impairment. That man, I declare, is\nhappy whom nothing makes less strong than he is; he keeps to the heights, leaning upon none but\nhimself; for one who sustains himself by any prop may fall. If the case is otherwise, then things\nwhich do not pertain to us will begin to have great influence over us. But who desires Fortune to\nhave the upper hand, or what sensible man prides himself upon that which is not his own?", "What is the happy life? It is peace of mind, and lasting tranquillity. This will be yours if you possess\ngreatness of soul; it will be yours if you possess the steadfastness that resolutely clings to a good\njudgment just reached. How does a man reach this condition? By gaining a complete view of truth,\nby maintaining, in all that he does, order, measure, fitness, and a will that is inoffensive and kindly,\nthat is intent upon reason and never departs therefrom, that commands at the same time love and\nadmiration. In short, to give you the principle in brief compass, the wise man's soul ought to be such\nas would be proper for a god. What more can one desire who possesses all honourable things? For\nif dishonourable things can contribute to the best estate, then there will be the possibility of a happy\nlife under conditions which do not include an honourable life. And what is more base or foolish than\nto connect the good of a rational soul with things irrational? Yet there are certain philosophers who\nhold that the Supreme Good admits of increase because it is hardly complete when the gifts of\nfortune are adverse. Even Antipater, one of the great leaders of this school, admits that he ascribes\nsome influence to externals, though only a very slight influence. You see, however, what absurdity\nlies in not being content with the daylight unless it is increased by a tiny fire. What importance can a\nspark have in the midst of this clear sunlight? If you are not contented with only that which is\nhonourable, it must follow that you desire in addition either the kind of quiet which the Greeks call\n\"undisturbedness,\" or else pleasure. But the former may be attained in any case. For the mind is\nfree from disturbance when it is fully free to contemplate the universe, and nothing distracts it from\nthe contemplation of nature. The second, pleasure, is simply the good of cattle. We are but adding\nthe irrational to the rational, the dishonourable to the honourable. A pleasant physical sensation\naffects this life of ours; why, therefore, do you hesitate to say that all is well with a man just because\nall is well with his appetite? And do you rate, I will not say among heroes, but among men, the\nperson whose Supreme Good is a matter of flavours and colours and sounds? Nay, let him withdraw\nfrom the ranks of this, the noblest class of living beings, second only to the gods; let him herd with\nthe dumb brutes ? an animal whose delight is in fodder!", "The irrational part of the soul is twofold: the one part is spirited, ambitious, uncontrolled; its seat is in\nthe passions; the other is lowly, sluggish, and devoted to pleasure. Philosophers have neglected the\nformer, which, though unbridled, is yet better, and is certainly more courageous and more worthy of\na man, and have regarded the latter, which is nerveless and ignoble, as indispensable to the happy\nlife. They have ordered reason to serve this latter; they have made the Supreme Good of the\nnoblest living being an abject and mean affair, and a monstrous hybrid, too, composed of various\nmembers\nwhich harmonize but ill. For as our Vergil, describing Scylla, says", "A beauteous breast, ? below, a monster huge\nOf bulk and shapeless, with a dolphin's tail\nJoined to a wolf-like belly.", "And yet to this Scylla are tacked on the forms of wild animals, dreadful and swift; but from what\nmonstrous shapes have these wiseacres compounded wisdom! Man's primary art is virtue itself;\nthere is joined to this the useless and fleeting flesh, fitted only for the reception of food, as\nPosidonius remarks. This divine virtue ends in foulness, and to the higher parts, which are\nworshipful and heavenly, there is fastened a sluggish and flabby animal. As for the second\ndesideratum, ? quiet, ? although it would indeed not of itself be of any benefit to the soul, yet it\nwould relieve the soul of hindrances; pleasure, on the contrary, actually destroys the soul and\nsoftens all its vigour. What elements so inharmonious as these can be found united? To that which\nis most vigorous is joined that which is most sluggish, to that which is austere that which is far from\nserious, to that which is most holy that which is unrestrained even to the point of impurity. \"What,\nthen,\" comes the retort, \"if good health, rest, and freedom from pain are not likely to hinder virtue,\nshall you not seek all these?\" Of course I shall seek them, but not because they are goods, ? I shall\nseek them because they are according to nature and because they will be acquired through the\nexercise of good judgment on my part. What, then, will be good in them? This alone, ? that it is a\ngood thing to choose them. For when I don suitable attire, or walk as I should, or dine as I ought to\ndine, it is not my dinner, or my walk, or my dress that are goods, but the deliberate choice which I\nshow in regard to them, as I observe, in each thing I do, a mean that conforms with reason. Let me\nalso add that the choice of neat clothing is a fitting object of a man's efforts; for man is by nature a\nneat and well-groomed animal. Hence the choice of neat attire, and not neat attire in itself, is a\ngood; since the good is not in the thing selected, but in the quality of the selection. Our actions are\nhonourable, but not the actual things which we do. And you may assume that what I have said about\ndress applies also to the body. For nature has surrounded our soul with the body as with a sort of\ngarment; the body is its cloak. But who has ever reckoned the value of clothes by the wardrobe\nwhich contained them? The scabbard does not make the sword good or bad. Therefore, with regard\nto the body I shall return the same answer to you, ? that, if I have the choice, I shall choose health\nand strength, but that the good involved will be my judgment regarding these things, and not the", "Things themselves touch not the soul, not in the least degree; nor have they admission to the soul,\nnor can they turn or move the soul: but the soul turns and moves itself alone, and whatever\njudgements it may think proper to make, such it makes for itself the things which present themselves\nto it.", "Another retort is: \"Granted that the wise man is happy; nevertheless, he does not attain the\nSupreme Good which we have defined, unless the means also which nature provides for its\nattainment are at his call. So, while one who possesses virtue cannot be unhappy, yet one cannot\nbe perfectly happy if one lacks such natural gifts as health, or soundness of limb.\" But in saying this,\nyou grant the alternative which seems the more difficult to believe, ? that the man who is in the midst\nof unremitting and extreme pain is not wretched, nay, is even happy; and you deny that which is\nmuch less serious, ? that he is completely happy. And yet, if virtue can keep a man from being\nwretched, it will be an easier task for it to render him completely happy. For the difference between\nhappiness and complete happiness is less than that between wretchedness and happiness. Can it\nbe possible that a thing which is so powerful as to snatch a man from disaster, and place him among\nthe happy, cannot also accomplish what remains, and render him supremely happy? Does its\nstrength fail at the very top of the climb? There are in life things which are advantageous and\ndisadvantageous, ? both beyond our control. If a good man, in spite of being weighed down by all\nkinds of disadvantages, is not wretched, how is he not supremely happy, no matter if he does lack\ncertain advantages? For as he is not weighted down to wretchedness by his burden of\ndisadvantages, so he is not withdrawn from supreme happiness through lack of any advantages;\nnay, he is just as supremely happy without the advantages as he is free from wretchedness though\nunder the load of his disadvantages. Otherwise, if his good can be impaired, it can be snatched from\nhim altogether.", "A short space above, I remarked that a tiny fire does not add to the sun's light. For by reason of the\nsun's brightness any light that shines apart from the sunlight is blotted out. \"But,\" one may say,\n\"there are certain objects that stand in the way even of the sunlight.\" The sun, however, is\nunimpaired even in the midst of obstacles, and, though an object may intervene and cut off our view\nthereof, the sun sticks to his work and goes on his course. Whenever he shines forth from amid the\nclouds, he is no smaller, nor less punctual either, than when he is free from clouds; since it makes a\ngreat deal of difference whether there is merely something in the way of his light or something which\ninterferes with his shining. Similarly, obstacles take nothing away from virtue; it is no smaller, but\nmerely shines with less brilliancy. In our eyes, it may perhaps be less visible and less luminous than\nbefore; but as regards itself it is the same and, like the sun when he is eclipsed, is still, though in\nsecret, putting forth its strength. Disasters, therefore, and losses, and wrongs, have only the same\npower over virtue that a cloud has over the sun.", "We meet with one person who maintains that a wise man who has met with bodily misfortune is\nneither wretched nor happy. But he also is in error, for he is putting the results of chance upon a\nparity with the virtues, and is attributing only the same influence to things that are honourable as to\nthings that are devoid of honour. But what is more detestable and more unworthy than to put\ncontemptible things in the same class with things worthy of reverence! For reverence is due to\njustice, duty, loyalty, bravery, and prudence; on the contrary, those attributes are worthless with\nwhich the most worthless men are often blessed in fuller measure, ? such as a sturdy leg, strong\nshoulders, good teeth, and healthy and solid muscles. Again, if the wise man whose body is a trial to\nhim shall be regarded as neither wretched nor happy, but shall be left in a sort of half-way position,\nhis life also will be neither desirable nor undesirable. But what is so foolish as to say that the wise\nman's life is not desirable? And what is so far beyond the bounds of credence as the opinion that\nany life is neither desirable nor undesirable? Again, if bodily ills do not make a man wretched, they\nconsequently allow him to be happy. For things which have no power to change his condition for the\nworse, have not the power, either, to disturb that condition when it is at its best.", "\"But,\" someone will say, \"we know what is cold and what is hot; a lukewarm temperature lies\nbetween. Similarly, A is happy, and B is wretched, and C is neither happy nor wretched.\" I wish to\nexamine this figure, which is brought into play against us. If I add to your lukewarm water a larger\nquantity of cold water, the result will be cold water. But if I pour in a larger quantity of hot water, the\nwater will finally become hot. In the case, however, of your man who is neither wretched nor happy,\nno matter how much I add to his troubles, he will not be unhappy, according to your argument;\nhence your figure offers no analogy. Again, suppose that I set before you a man who is neither\nmiserable nor happy. I add blindness to his misfortunes; he is not rendered unhappy. I cripple him;\nhe is not rendered unhappy. I add afflictions which are unceasing and severe; he is not rendered\nunhappy. Therefore, one whose life is not changed to misery by all these ills is not dragged by them,\neither, from his life of happiness. Then if, as you say, the wise man cannot fall from happiness to\nwretchedness, he cannot fall into non-happiness. For how, if one has begun to slip, can one stop at\nany particular place? That which prevents him from rolling to the bottom, keeps him at the summit.\nWhy, you urge, may not a happy life possibly be destroyed? It cannot even be disjointed; and for\nthat reason virtue is itself of itself sufficient for the happy life.", "\"But,\" it is said, \"is not the wise man happier if he has lived longer and has been distracted by no\npain, than one who has always been compelled to grapple with evil fortune?\" Answer me now, ? is\nhe any better or more honourable? If he is not, then he is not happier either. In order to live more\nhappily, he must live more rightly; if he cannot do that, then he cannot live more happily either.\nVirtue cannot be strained tighter, and therefore neither can the happy life, which depends on virtue.\nFor virtue is so great a good that it is not affected by such insignificant assaults upon it as shortness\nof life, pain, and the various bodily vexations. For pleasure does not deserve that. virtue should even\nglance at it. Now what is the chief thing in virtue? It is the quality of not needing a single day beyond\nthe present, and of not reckoning up the days that are ours; in the slightest possible moment of time\nvirtue completes an eternity of good. These goods seem to us incredible and transcending man's\nnature; for we measure its grandeur by the standard of our own weakness, and we call our vices by\nthe name of virtue. Furthermore, does it not seem just as incredible that any man in the midst of\nextreme suffering should say, \"I am happy\"? And yet this utterance was heard in the very factory of\npleasure, when Epicurus said: \"To-day and one other day have been the happiest of all!\" although in\nthe one case he was tortured by strangury, and in the other by the incurable pain of an ulcerated\nstomach. Why, then, should those goods which virtue bestows be incredible in the sight of us, who\ncultivate virtue, when they are found even in those who acknowledge pleasure as their mistress?\nThese also, ignoble and base-minded as they are, declare that even in the midst of excessive pain\nand misfortune the wise man will be neither wretched nor happy. And yet this also is incredible, ?\nnay, still more incredible than the other case. For I do not understand how, if virtue falls from her\nheights, she can help being hurled all the way to the bottom. She either must preserve one in\nhappiness, or, if driven from this position, she will not prevent us from becoming unhappy. If virtue\nonly stands her ground, she cannot be driven from the field; she must either conquer or be\nconquered.", "But some say: \"Only to the immortal gods is given virtue and the happy life; we can attain but the\nshadow, as it were, and semblance of such goods as theirs. We approach them, but we never reach\nthem.\" Reason, however, is a common attribute of both gods and men; in the gods it is already\nperfected, in us it is capable of being perfected. But it is our vices that bring us to despair; for the\nsecond class of rational being, man, is of an inferior order, ? a guardian, as it were, who is too\nunstable to hold fast to what is best, his judgment still wavering and uncertain. He may require the\nfaculties of sight and hearing, good health, a bodily exterior that is not loathsome, and, besides,\ngreater length of days conjoined with an unimpaired constitution. Though by means of reason he\ncan lead a life which will not bring regrets, yet there resides in this imperfect creature, man, a certain\npower that makes for badness, because he possesses a mind which is easily moved to perversity.\nSuppose, however, the badness which is in full view, and has previously been stirred to activity, to\nbe removed; the man is still not a good man, but he is being moulded to goodness. One, however,\nin whom there is lacking any quality that makes for goodness, is bad.", "is equal to the gods; mindful of his origin, he strives to return thither. No man does wrong in\nattempting to regain the heights from which he once came down. And why should you not believe\nthat something of divinity exists in one who is a part of God? All this universe which encompasses\nus is one, and it is God; we are associates of God; we are his members. Our soul has capabilities,\nand is carried thither, if vices do not hold it down. Just as it is the nature of our bodies to stand erect\nand look upward to the sky, so the soul, which may reach out as far as it will, was framed by nature\nto this end, that it should desire equality with the gods. And if it makes use of its powers and\nstretches upward into its proper region it is by no alien path that it struggles toward the heights. It\nwould be a great task to journey heavenwards; the soul but returns thither. When once it has found\nthe road, it boldly marches on, scornful of all things. It casts, no backward glance at wealth; gold and\nsilver ? things which are fully worthy of the gloom in which they once lay ? it values not by the sheen\nwhich smites the eyes of the ignorant, but by the mire of ancient days, whence our greed first\ndetached and dug them out.", "The soul, I affirm, knows that riches are stored elsewhere than in men's heaped-up treasure-houses;\nthat it is the soul, and not the strong-box, which should be filled. It is the soul that men may set in\ndominion over all things, and may install as owner of the universe, so that it may limit its riches only\nby the boundaries of East and West, and, like the gods, may possess all things; and that it may, with\nits own vast resources, look down from on high upon the wealthy, no one of whom rejoices as much\nin his own wealth as he resents the wealth of another. When the soul has transported itself to this\nlofty height, it regards the body also, since it is a burden which must be borne, not as a thing to love,\nbut as a thing to oversee; nor is it subservient to that over which it is set in mastery. For no man is\nfree who is a slave to his body. Indeed, omitting all the other masters which are brought into being\nby excessive care for the body, the sway which the body itself exercises is captious and fastidious.\nForth from this body the soul issues, now with unruffled spirit, now with exultation, and, when once it\nhas gone forth, asks not what shall be the end of the deserted clay. No; just as we do not take\nthought for the clippings of the hair and the beard, even so that divine soul, when it is about to issue\nforth from the mortal man, regards the destination of its earthly vessel ? whether it be consumed by\nfire, or shut in by a stone, or buried in the earth, or torn by wild beasts ? as being of no more\nconcern to itself than is the afterbirth to a child just born. And whether this body shall be cast out\nand plucked to pieces by birds, or devoured when", "how does that concern him who is nothing? Nay even when it is among the living, the soul fears\nnothing that may happen to the body after death; for though such things may have been threats,\nthey were not enough to terrify the soul previous to the moment of death. It says: \"I am not\nfrightened by the executioner's hook, nor by the revolting mutilation of the corpse which is exposed\nto the scorn of those who would witness the spectacle. I ask no man to perform the last rites for me;\nI entrust my remains to none. Nature has made provision that none shall go unburied. Time will lay\naway one whom cruelty has cast forth.\" Those were eloquent words which Maecenas uttered:", "In one respect man is the nearest thing to me, so far as I must do good to men and endure them.\nBut so far as some men make themselves obstacles to my proper acts, man becomes to me one of\nthe things which are indifferent, no less than the sun or wind or a wild beast. Now it is true that these\nmay impede my action, but they are no impediments to my affects and disposition, which have the\npower of acting conditionally and changing: for the mind converts and changes every hindrance to\nits activity into an aid; and so that which is a hindrance is made a furtherance to an act; and that\nwhich is an obstacle on the road helps us on this road.", "You would imagine that this was the saying of a man of strict principles. He was indeed a man of\nnoble and robust native gifts, but in prosperity he impaired these gifts by laxness. Farewell.", "While reading the letter in which you were lamenting the death of the philosopher Metronax as if he\nmight have, and indeed ought to have, lived longer, I missed the spirit of fairness which abounds in\nall your discussions concerning men and things, but is lacking when you approach one single\nsubject, ? as is indeed the case with us all. In other words, I have noticed many who deal fairly with\ntheir fellow-men, but none who deals fairly with the gods. We rail every day at Fate, saying \"Why\nhas A. been carried off in the very middle of his career? Why is not B. carried off instead? Why\nshould he prolong his old age, which is a burden to himself as well as to others?\"", "But tell me, pray, do you consider it fairer that you should obey Nature, or that Nature should obey\nyou? And what difference does it make how soon you depart from a place which you must depart\nfrom sooner or later? We should strive, not to live long, but to live rightly; for to achieve long life you\nhave need of Fate only, but for right living you need the soul. A life is really long if it is a full life; but\nfulness is not attained until the soul has rendered to itself its proper Good, that is, until it has\nassumed control over itself. What benefit does this older man derive from the eighty years he has\nspent in idleness? A person like him has not lived; he has merely tarried awhile in life. Nor has he\ndied late in life; he has simply been a long time dying. He has lived eighty years, has he? That\ndepends upon the date from which you reckon his death! Your other friend, however, departed in\nthe bloom of his manhood. But he had fulfilled all the duties of a good citizen, a good friend, a good\nson; in no respect had he fallen short. His age may have been incomplete, but his life was complete.\nThe other man has lived eighty years, has he? Nay, he has existed eighty years, unless perchance\nyou mean by \"he has lived\" what we mean when we say that a tree \"lives.\"", "Pray, let us see to it, my dear Lucilius, that our lives, like jewels of great price, be noteworthy not\nbecause of their width but because of their weight. Let us measure them by their performance, not\nby their duration. Would you know wherein lies the difference between this hardy man who,\ndespising Fortune, has served through every campaign of life and has attained to life's Supreme\nGood, and that other person over whose head many years have passed? The former exists even\nafter his death; the latter has died even before he was dead.", "We should therefore praise, and number in the company of the blest, that man who has invested\nwell the portion of time, however little, that has been allotted to him; for such a one has seen the\ntrue light. He has not been one of the common herd. He has not only lived, but flourished.\nSometimes he enjoyed fair skies; sometimes, as often happens, it was only through the clouds that\nthere flashed to him the radiance of the mighty star. Why do you ask: \"How long did he live?\" He still\nlives! At one bound he has passed over into posterity and has consigned himself to the guardianship\nof memory.", "And yet I would not on that account decline for myself a few additional years; although, if my life's\nspace be shortened, I shall not say that I have lacked aught that is essential to a happy life. For I\nhave not planned to live up to the very last day that my greedy hopes had promised me; nay, I have\nlooked upon every day as if it were my last. Why ask the date of my birth, or whether I am still\nenrolled on the register of the younger men? What I have is my own. Just as one of small stature\ncan be a perfect man, so a life of small compass can be a perfect life. Age ranks among the external\nthings. How long I am to exist is not mine to decide, but how long I shall go on existing in my present\nway is in my own control.

It is living until you possess wisdom. He who has\nattained wisdom has reached, not the furthermost, but the most important, goal.

He will indeed have the right to do so, for he has paid her\nback a better life than he has received. He has set up the pattern of a good man, showing the\nquality and the greatness of a good man. Had another year been added, it would merely have been\nlike the past.", "And yet how long are we to keep living? We have had the joy of learning the truth about the\nuniverse. We know from what beginnings Nature arises; how she orders the course of the heavens;\nby what successive changes she summons back the year; how she has brought to an end all things\nthat ever have been, and has established herself as the only end of her own being. We know that\nthe stars move by their own motion, and that nothing except the earth stands still, while all the other\nbodies run on with uninterrupted swiftness. We know how the moon outstrips the sun; why it is that\nthe slower leaves the swifter behind; in what manner she receives her light, or loses it again; what\nbrings on the night, and what brings back the day.

When a man has gained a complete understanding of this definition and has\nthoroughly learned it, he can frame for himself a precept directing what is to be done in a given\ncase. Just as the student of javelin-throwing keeps aiming at a fixed target and thus trains the hand\nto give direction to the missile, and when, by instruction and practice, he has gained the desired\nability he can then employ it against any target he wishes (having learned to strike not any random\nobject, but precisely the object at which he has aimed), ? he who has equipped himself for the whole\nof life does not need to be advised concerning each separate item, because he is now trained to\nmeet his problem as a whole; for he knows not merely how he should live with his wife or his son,\nbut how he should live aright.

This subject is therefore twofold, leading to two\nseparate lines of inquiry: first, Is it useful or useless? and, second, Can it of itself produce a good\nman? ? in other words, Is it superfluous, or does it render all other departments superfluous?", "Those who urge the view that this department is superfluous argue as follows: \"If an object that is\nheld in front of the eyes interferes with the vision, it must be removed.

Similarly, when something blinds a man's soul and hinders it from seeing a line of\nduty clearly, there is no use in advising him: 'Live thus and so with your father, thus and so with your\nwife.' For precepts will be of no avail while the mind is clouded with error; only when the cloud is\ndispersed will it be clear what one's duty is in each case. Otherwise, you will merely be showing the\nsick man what he ought to do if he were well, instead of making him well. Suppose you are trying to\nreveal to the poor man the art of 'acting rich'; how can the thing be accomplished as long as his\npoverty is unaltered? You are trying to make clear to a starveling in what manner he is to act the\npart of one with a well-filled stomach; the first requisite, however, is to relieve him of the hunger that\ngrips his vitals.", "\"The same thing, I assure you, holds good of all faults; the faults themselves must be removed, and\nprecepts should not be given which cannot possibly be carried out while the faults remain. Unless\nyou drive out the false opinions under which we suffer, the miser will never receive instruction as to\nthe proper use of his money, nor the coward regarding the way to scorn danger. You must make the\nmiser know that money is neither a good nor an evil; show him men of wealth who are miserable to\nthe last degree. You must make the coward know that the things which generally frighten us out of\nour wits are less to be feared than rumour advertises them to be, whether the object of fear be\nsuffering or death; that when death comes ? fixed by law for us all to suffer ? it is often a great\nsolace to reflect that it can never come again; that in the midst of suffering resoluteness of soul will\nbe as good as a cure, for the soul renders lighter any burden that it endures with stubborn defiance.\nRemember that pain has this most excellent quality: if prolonged it cannot be severe, and if severe it\ncannot be prolonged; and that we should bravely accept whatever commands the inevitable laws of\nthe universe lay upon us.", "\"When by means of such doctrines you have brought the erring man to a sense of his own condition,\nwhen he has learned that the happy life is not that which conforms to pleasure, but that which\nconforms to Nature, when he has fallen deeply in love with virtue as man's sole good and has\navoided baseness as man's sole evil, and when he knows that all other things ? riches, office,\nhealth, strength, dominion ? fall in between and are not to be reckoned either among goods or\namong evils, then he will not need a monitor for every separate action, to say to him: 'Walk thus and\nso, eat thus and so. This is the conduct proper for a man and that for a woman; this for a married\nman and that for a bachelor.' Indeed, the persons who take the greatest pains to proffer such advice\nare themselves unable to put it into practice. It is thus that the pedagogue advises the boy, and the\ngrandmother her grandson; it is the hottest-tempered schoolmaster who contends that one should\nnever lose one's temper. Go into any elementary school, and you will learn that just such\npronouncements, emanating from high-browed philosophers, are to be found in the lesson-book for\nboys!", "\"Shall you then offer precepts that are clear, or precepts that are doubtful? Those which are clear\nneed no counsellor, and doubtful precepts gain no credence; so the giving of precepts is\nsuperfluous. Indeed you should study the problem in this way: if you are counselling someone on a\nmatter which is of doubtful clearness and doubtful meaning, you must supplement your precepts by\nproofs; and if you must resort to proofs, your means of proof are more effective and more\nsatisfactory in themselves. 'It is thus that you must treat your friend, thus your fellow citizen, thus\nyour associate.' And why? 'Because it is just.' Yet I can find all that material included under the head\nof Justice. I find there that fair play is desirable in itself, that we are not forced into it by fear nor\nhired to that end for pay, and that no man is just who is attracted by anything in this virtue other than\nthe virtue itself. After convincing myself of this view and thoroughly absorbing it, what good can I\nobtain from such precepts, which only teach one who is already trained? To one who knows, it is\nsuperfluous to give precepts; to one who does not know, it is insufficient. For he must be told, not\nonly what he is being instructed to do, but also why. I repeat, are such precepts useful to him who\nhas correct ideas about good and evil, or to one who has them not? The latter will receive no benefit\nfrom you; for some idea that clashes with your counsel has already monopolized his attention. He\nwho has made a careful decision as to what should be sought and what should be avoided knows\nwhat he ought to do, without a single word from you. Therefore, that whole department of philosophy\nmay be abolished.", "\"There are two reasons why we go astray: either there is in the soul an evil quality which has been\nbrought about by wrong opinions, or, even if not possessed by false ideas, the soul is prone to\nfalsehood and rapidly corrupted by some outward appearance which attracts it in the wrong\ndirection. For this reason it is our duty either to treat carefully the diseased mind and free it from\nfaults, or to take possession of the mind when it is still unoccupied and yet inclined to what is evil.\nBoth these results can be attained by the main doctrines of philosophy; therefore the giving of such\nprecepts is of no use. Besides, if we give forth precepts to each individual, the task is stupendous.\nFor one class of advice should be given to the financier, another to the farmer, another to the\nbusiness man, another to one who cultivates the good graces of royalty, another to him who will\nseek the friendship of his equals, another to him who will court those of lower rank. In the case of\nmarriage, you will advise one person how he should conduct himself with a wife who before her\nmarriage was a maiden, and another how he should behave with a woman who had previously been\nwedded to another; how the husband of a rich woman should act, or another man with a dowerless\nspouse. Or do you not think that there is some difference between a barren woman and one who\nbears children, between one advanced in years and a mere girl, between a mother and a\nstep-mother? We cannot include all the types, and yet each type requires separate treatment; but\nthe laws of philosophy are concise and are binding in all cases. Moreover, the precepts of wisdom\nshould be definite and certain: when things cannot be defined, they are outside the sphere of\nwisdom; for wisdom knows the proper limits of things.", "\"We should therefore do away with this department of precepts, because it cannot afford to all what\nit promises only to a few; wisdom, however, embraces all. Between the insanity of people in general\nand the insanity which is subject to medical treatment there is no difference, except that the latter is\nsuffering from disease and the former from false opinions. In the one case, the symptoms of\nmadness may be traced to ill-health; the other is the ill-health of the mind. If one should offer\nprecepts to a madman ? how he ought to speak, how he ought to walk, how he ought to conduct\nhimself in public and in private, he would be more of a lunatic than the person whom he was\nadvising. What is really necessary is to treat the black bile and remove the essential cause of the\nmadness. And this is what should also be done in the other case ? that of the mind diseased. The\nmadness itself must be shaken off; otherwise, your words of advice will vanish into thin air.\"", "This is what Aristo says; and I shall answer his arguments one by one. First, in opposition to what he\nsays about one's obligation to remove that which blocks the eye and hinders the vision. I admit that\nsuch a person does not need precepts in order to see, but that he needs treatment for the curing of\nhis eyesight and the getting rid of the hindrance that handicaps him. For it is Nature that gives us\nour eyesight; and he who removes obstacles restores to Nature her proper function. But Nature\ndoes not teach us our duty in every case. Again, if a man's cataract is cured, he cannot, immediately\nafter his recovery, give back their eyesight to other men also; but when we are freed from evil we\ncan free others also. There is no need of encouragement, or even of counsel, for the eye to be able\nto distinguish different colours; black and white can be differentiated without prompting from\nanother. The mind, on the other hand, needs many precepts in order to see what it should do in life;\nalthough in eye-treatment also the physician not only accomplishes the cure, but gives advice into\nthe bargain. He says: \"There is no reason why you should at once expose your weak vision to a\ndangerous glare; begin with darkness, and then go into half-lights, and finally be more bold,\naccustoming yourself gradually to the bright light of day. There is no reason why you should study\nimmediately after eating; there is no reason why you should impose hard tasks upon your eyes\nwhen they are swollen and inflamed; avoid winds and strong blasts of cold air that blow into your\nface,\" ? and other suggestions of the same sort, which are just as valuable as drugs themselves.\nThe physician's art supplements remedies by advice.", "\"But,\" comes the reply, \"error is the source of sin; precepts do not remove error, nor do they rout our\nfalse opinions on the subject of Good and Evil.\" I admit that precepts alone are not effective in\noverthrowing the mind's mistaken beliefs; but they do not on that account fail to be of service when\nthey accompany other measures also. In the first place, they refresh the memory; in the second\nplace, when sorted into their proper classes, the matters which showed themselves in a jumbled\nmass when considered as a whole, can be considered in this with greater care. According to our\nopponents theory, you might even say that consolation, and exhortation were superfluous. Yet they\nare not superfluous; neither, therefore, is counsel.", "That which does no harm to the state, does no harm to the citizen. In the case of every appearance\nof harm apply this rule: if the state is not harmed by this, neither am I harmed. But if the state is\nharmed, thou must not be angry with him who does harm to the state. Show him where his error is.", "\"But it is folly,\" they retort, \"to prescribe what a sick man ought to do, just as if he were well, when\nyou should really restore his health; for without health precepts are not worth a jot.\" But have not\nsick men and sound men something in common, concerning which they need continual advice? For\nexample, not to grasp greedily after food, and to avoid getting over-tired. Poor and rich have certain\nprecepts which fit them both. \"Cure their greed, then,\" people say, \"and you will not need to lecture\neither the poor or the rich, provided that in the case of each of them the craving has subsided.\" But\nis it not one thing to be free from lust for money, and another thing to know how to use this money?\nMisers do not know the proper limits in money matters, but even those who are not misers fail to\ncomprehend its use. Then comes the reply: \"Do away with error, and your precepts become\nunnecessary.\" That is wrong; for suppose that avarice is slackened, that luxury is confined, that\nrashness is reined in, and that laziness is pricked by the spur; even after vices are removed, we\nmust continue to learn what we ought to do, and how we ought to do it.", "\"Nothing,\" it is said, \"will be accomplished by applying advice to the more serious faults.\" No; and\nnot even medicine can master incurable diseases; it is nevertheless used in some cases as a\nremedy, in others as a relief. Not even the power of universal philosophy, though it summon all its\nstrength for the purpose, will remove from the soul what is now a stubborn and chronic disease. But\nWisdom, merely because she cannot cure everything, is not incapable of making cures. People say:\n\"What good does it do to point out the obvious?\" A great deal of good; for we sometimes know facts\nwithout paying attention to them. Advice is not teaching; it merely engages the attention and rouses\nus, and concentrates the memory, and keeps it from losing grip. We miss much that is set before our\nvery eyes. Advice is, in fact, a sort of exhortation. The mind often tries not to notice even that which\nlies before our eyes; we must therefore force upon it the knowledge of things that are perfectly well\nknown. One might repeat here the saying of Calvus about Vatinius: \"You all know that bribery has\nbeen going on, and everyone knows that you know it.\" You know that friendship should be\nscrupulously honoured, and yet you do not hold it in honour. You know that a man does wrong in\nrequiring chastity of his wife while he himself is intriguing with the wives of other men; you know that,\nas your wife should have no dealings with a lover, neither should you yourself with a mistress; and\nyet you do not act accordingly. Hence, you must be continually brought to remember these facts; for\nthey should not be in storage, but ready for use. And whatever is wholesome should be often\ndiscussed and often brought before the mind, so that it may be not only familiar to us, but also ready\nto hand. And remember, too, that in this way what is clear often becomes clearer.", "\"But if,\" comes the answer, \"your precepts are not obvious, you will be bound to add proofs; hence\nthe proofs, and not the precepts, will be helpful.\" But cannot the influence of the monitor avail even\nwithout proofs? It is like the opinions of a legal expert, which hold good even though the reasons for\nthem are not delivered. Moreover, the precepts which are given are of great weight in themselves,\nwhether they be woven into the fabric of song, or condensed into prose proverbs, like the famous\nWisdom of Cato \"Buy not what you need, but what you must have. That which you do not need, is\ndear even at a farthing.\" Or those oracular or oracular-like replies, such as \"Be thrifty with time!\"\n\"Know thyself!\" Shall you need to be told the meaning when someone repeats to you lines like\nthese:", "Fortune favours the brave, but the coward is foiled by his faint heart.", "Such maxims need no special pleader; they go straight to our emotions, and help us simply because\nNature is exercising her proper function. The soul carries within itself the seed of everything that is\nhonourable, and this seed is stirred to growth by advice, as a spark that is fanned by a gentle\nbreeze develops its natural fire. Virtue is aroused by a touch, a shock. Moreover, there are certain\nthings which, though in the mind, yet are not ready to hand but begin to function easily as soon as\nthey are put into words. Certain things lie scattered about in various places, and it is impossible for\nthe unpractised mind to arrange them in order. Therefore, we should bring them into unity, and join\nthem, so that they may be more powerful and more of an uplift to the soul. Or, if precepts do not\navail at all, then every method of instruction should be abolished, and we should be content with\nNature alone.", "Those who maintain this view do not understand that one man is lively and alert of wit, another\nsluggish and dull, while certainly some men have more intelligence than others. The strength of the\nwit is nourished and kept growing by precepts; it adds new points of view to those which are inborn\nand corrects depraved ideas. \"But suppose,\" people retort, \"that a man is not the possessor of\nsound dogmas, how can advice help him when he is chained down by vicious dogmas?\" In this,\nassuredly, that he is freed therefrom; for his natural disposition has not been crushed, but\nover-shadowed and kept down. Even so it goes on endeavouring to rise again, struggling against\nthe influences that make for evil; but when it wins support and receives the aid of precepts, it grows\nstronger, provided only that the chronic trouble has not corrupted or annihilated the natural man. For\nin such a case, not even the training that comes from philosophy, striving with all its might, will make\nrestoration. What difference, indeed, ? is there between the dogmas of philosophy and precepts,\nunless it be this ? that the former are general and the latter special? Both deal with advice ? the one\nthrough the universal, the other through the particular.", "Some say: \"If one is familiar with upright and honourable dogmas, it will be superfluous to advise\nhim.\" By no means; for this person has indeed learned to do things which he ought to do; but he\ndoes not see with sufficient clearness what these things are. For we are hindered from\naccomplishing praiseworthy deeds not only by our emotions, but also by want of practice in\ndiscovering the demands of a particular situation. Our minds are often under good control, and yet\nat the same time are inactive and untrained in finding the path of duty, ? and advice makes this\nclear. Again, it is written: \"Cast out all false opinions concerning Good and Evil, but replace them\nwith true opinions; then advice will have no function to perform.\" Order in the soul can doubtless be\nestablished in this way; but these are not the only ways. For although we may infer by proofs just\nwhat Good and Evil are, nevertheless precepts have their proper r\u00f4le. Prudence and justice consist\nof certain duties; and duties are set in order by precepts. Moreover, judgment as to Good and Evil is\nitself strengthened by following up our duties, and precepts conduct us to this end. For both are in\naccord with each other; nor can precepts take the lead unless the duties follow. They observe their\nnatural order; hence precepts clearly come first.", "\"Precepts,\" it is said \"are numberless.\" Wrong again! For they are not numberless so far as\nconcerns important and essential things. Of course there are slight distinctions, due to the time, or\nthe place, or the person; but even in these cases, precepts are given which have a general\napplication. \"No one, however,\" it is said, \"cures madness by precepts, and therefore not\nwickedness either.\" There is a distinction; for if you rid a man of insanity, he becomes sane again,\nbut if we have removed false opinions, insight into practical conduct does not at once follow. Even\nthough it follows, counsel will none the less confirm one's right opinion concerning Good and Evil.\nAnd it is also wrong to believe that precepts are of no use to madmen. For though, by themselves,\nthey are of no avail, yet they are a help towards the cure. Both scolding and chastening rein in a\nlunatic. Note that I here refer to lunatics whose wits are disturbed but not hopelessly gone.", "\"Still,\" it is objected, \"laws do not always make us do what we ought to do; and what else are laws\nthan precepts mingled with threats?\" Now first of all, the laws do not persuade just because they\nthreaten; precepts, however, instead of coercing, correct men by pleading. Again, laws frighten one\nout of communicating crime, while precepts urge a man on to his duty. Besides, the laws also are of\nassistance towards good conduct, at any rate if they instruct as well as command. On this point I\ndisagree with Posidonius, who says: \"I do not think that Plato's Laws should have the preambles\nadded to them. For a law should be brief, in order that the uninitiated may grasp it all the more\neasily. It should be a voice, as it were, sent down from heaven; it should command, not discuss.\nNothing seems to me more dull or more foolish than a law with a preamble. Warn me, tell me what\nyou wish me to do; I am not learning but obeying.\" But laws framed in this way are helpful; hence\nyou will notice that a state with defective laws will have defective morals. \"But,\" it is said, \"they are\nnot of avail in every case.\" Well neither is philosophy; and yet philosophy is not on that account\nineffectual and useless in the training of the soul. Furthermore, is not philosophy the Law of Life?\nGrant, if we will, that the laws do not avail; it does not necessarily follow that advice also should not\navail. On this ground, you ought to say that consolation does not avail, and warning, and\nexhortation, and scolding, and praising; since they are all varieties of advice. It is by such methods\nthat we arrive at a perfect condition of mind. Nothing is more successful in bringing honourable\ninfluences to bear upon the mind, or in straightening out the wavering spirit that is prone to evil, than\nassociation with good men. For the frequent seeing, the frequent hearing of them little by little sinks\ninto the heart and acquires the force of precepts.", "Often think of the rapidity with which things pass by and disappear, both the things which are and\nthe things which are produced. For substance is like a river in a continual flow, and the activities of\nthings are in constant change, and the causes work in infinite varieties; and there is hardly anything\nwhich stands still. And consider this which is near to thee, this boundless abyss of the past and of\nthe future in which all things disappear. How then is he not a fool who is puffed up with such things\nor plagued about them and makes himself miserable? for they vex him only for a time, and a short\ntime.", "We are indeed uplifted merely by meeting wise men; and one can be helped by a great man even\nwhen he is silent. I could not easily tell you how it helps us, though I am certain of the fact that I\nhave received help in that way. Phaedo says: \"Certain tiny animals do not leave any pain when they\nsting us; so subtle is their power, so deceptive for purposes of harm. The bite is disclosed by a\nswelling, and even in the swelling there is no visible wound.\" That will also be your experience when\ndealing with wise men, you will not discover how or when the benefit comes to you, but you will\ndiscover that you have received it. \"What is the point of this remark?\" you ask. It is, that good\nprecepts, often welcomed within you, will benefit you just as much as good examples. Pythagoras\ndeclares that our souls experience a change when we enter a temple and behold the images of the\ngods face to face, and await the utterances of an oracle. Moreover, who can deny that even the\nmost inexperienced are effectively struck by the force of certain precepts? For example, by such\nbrief but weighty saws as: \"Nothing in excess,\" \"The greedy mind is satisfied by no gains,\" \"You\nmust expect to be treated by others as you yourself have treated them.\" We receive a sort if shock\nwhen we hear such sayings; no one ever thinks of doubting them or of asking \"Why?\" So strongly,\nindeed, does mere truth, unaccompanied by reason, attract us. If reverence reins in the soul and\nchecks vice, why cannot counsel do the same? Also, if rebuke gives one a sense of shame, why\nhas not counsel the same power, even though it does use bare precepts? The counsel which\nassists suggestion by reason ? which adds the motive for doing a given thing and the reward which\nawaits one who carries out and obeys such precepts is ? more effective and settles deeper in the\nheart. If commands are helpful, so is advice. But one is helped by commands; therefore one is\nhelped also by advice.", "Virtue is divided into two parts ? into contemplation of truth, and conduct. Training teaches\ncontemplation, and admonition teaches conduct. And right conduct both practises and reveals\nvirtue. But if, when a man is about to act, he is helped by advice, he is also helped by admonition.\nTherefore, if right conduct is necessary to virtue, and if, moreover, admonition makes clear right\nconduct, then admonition also is an indispensable thing. There are two strong supports to the soul ?\ntrust in the truth and confidence; both are the result of admonition. For men believe it, and when\nbelief is established, the soul receives great inspiration and is filled with confidence. Therefore,\nadmonition is not superfluous.", "Marcus Agrippa, a great-souled man, the only person among those whom the civil wars raised to\nfame and power whose prosperity helped the state, used to say that he was greatly indebted to the\nproverb \"Harmony makes small things grow; lack of harmony makes great things decay.\" He held\nthat he himself became the best of brothers and the best of friends by virtue of this saying. And if\nproverbs of such a kind, when welcomed intimately into the soul, can mould this very soul, why\ncannot the department of philosophy which consists of such proverbs possess equal influence?\nVirtue depends partly upon training and partly upon practice; you must learn first, and then\nstrengthen your learning by action. If this be true, not only do the doctrines of wisdom help us but\nthe precepts also, which check and banish our emotions by a sort of official decree.", "It is said: \"Philosophy is divided into knowledge and state of mind. For one who has learned and\nunderstood what he should do and avoid, is not a wise man until his mind is metamorphosed into\nthe shape of that which he has learned. This third department ? that of precept ? is compounded\nfrom both the others, from dogmas of philosophy and state of mind. Hence it is superfluous as far as\nthe perfecting of virtue is concerned; the other two parts are enough for the purpose.\" On that basis,\ntherefore, even consolation would be superfluous, since this also is a combination of the other two,\nas likewise are exhortation, persuasion, and even proof itself. For proof also originates from a\nwell-ordered and firm mental attitude. But, although these things result from a sound state of mind,\nyet the sound state of mind also results from them; it is both creative of them and resultant from\nthem. Furthermore, that which you mention is the mark of an already perfect man, of one who has\nattained the height of human happiness. But the approach to these qualities is slow, and in the\nmeantime in practical matters, the path should be pointed out for the benefit of one who is still short\nof perfection, but is making progress. Wisdom by her own agency may perhaps show herself this\npath without the help of admonition; for she has brought the soul to a stage where it can be impelled\nonly in the right direction. Weaker characters, however, need someone to precede them, to say:\n\"Avoid this,\" or \"Do that.\" Moreover, if one awaits the time when one can know of oneself what the\nbest line of action is, one will sometimes go astray and by going astray will be hindered from arriving\nat the point where it is possible to be content with oneself. The soul should accordingly be guided at\nthe very moment when it is becoming able to guide itself. Boys study according to direction. Their\nfingers are held and guided by others so that they may follow the outlines of the letters; next, they\nare ordered to imitate a copy and base thereon a style of penmanship. Similarly, the mind is helped\nif it is taught according to direction. Such facts as these prove that this department of philosophy is\nnot superfluous.", "The question next arises whether this part alone is sufficient to make men wise. The problem shall\nbe treated at the proper time; but at present, omitting all arguments, is it not clear that we need\nsomeone whom we may call upon as our preceptor in opposition to the precepts of men in general?\nThere is no word which reaches our ears without doing us harm; we are injured both by good wishes\nand by curses. The angry prayers of our enemies instil false fears in us; and the affection of our\nfriends spoils us through their kindly wishes. For this affection sets us a-groping after goods that are\nfar away, unsure, and wavering, when we really might open the store of happiness at home. We are\nnot allowed, I maintain, to travel a straight road. Our parents and our slaves draw us into wrong.\nNobody confines his mistakes to himself; people sprinkle folly among their neighbours, and receive it\nfrom them in turn. For this reason, in an individual, you find the vices of nations, because the nation\nhas given them to the individual. Each man, in corrupting others, corrupts himself; he imbibes, and\nthen imparts, badness the result is a vast mass of wickedness, because the worst in every separate\nperson is concentrated in one mass.", "We should, therefore, have a guardian, as it were, to pluck us continually by the ear and dispel\nrumours and protest against popular enthusiasms. For you are mistaken if you suppose that our\nfaults are inborn in us; they have come from without, have been heaped upon us. Hence, by\nreceiving frequent admonitions, we can reject the opinions which din about our ears. Nature does\nnot ally us with any vice; she produced us in health and freedom. She put before our eyes no object\nwhich might stir in us the itch of greed. She placed gold and silver beneath our feet, and bade those\nfeet stamp down and crush everything that causes us to be stamped down and crushed. Nature\nelevated our gaze towards the sky and willed that we should look upward to behold her glorious and\nwonderful works. She gave us the rising and the setting sun, the whirling course of the on-rushing\nworld which discloses the things of earth by day and the heavenly bodies by night, the movements\nof the stars, which are slow if you compare them with the universe, but most rapid if you reflect on\nthe size of the orbits which they describe with unslackened speed; she showed us the successive\neclipses of sun and moon, and other phenomena, wonderful because they occur regularly or\nbecause, through sudden causes they leap into view ? such as nightly trails of fire, or flashes in the\nopen heavens unaccompanied by stroke or sound of thunder, or columns and beams and the\nvarious phenomena of flames. She ordained that all these bodies should proceed above our heads;\nbut gold and silver, with the iron which, because of the gold and silver, never brings peace, she has\nhidden away, as if they were dangerous things to trust to our keeping. It is we ourselves that have\ndragged them into the light of day to the end that we might fight over them; it is we ourselves who,\ntearing away the superincumbent earth, have dug out the causes and tools of our own destruction; it\nis we ourselves who have attributed our own misdeeds to Fortune, and do not blush to regard as the\nloftiest objects those which once lay in the depths of earth. Do you wish to know how false is the\ngleam that has deceived your eyes? There is really nothing fouler or more involved in darkness than\nthese things of earth, sunk and covered for so long a time in the mud where they belong. Of course\nthey are foul; they have been hauled out through a long and murky mine-shaft. There is nothing\nuglier than these metals during the process of refinement and separation from the ore. Furthermore,", "watch the very workmen who must handle and sift the barren grade of dirt, the sort which comes\nfrom the bottom; see how soot-besmeared they are! And yet the stuff they handle soils the soul\nmore than the body, and there is more foulness in the owner than in the workman.", "It is therefore indispensable that we be admonished, that we have some advocate with upright mind,\nand, amid all the uproar and jangle of falsehood, hear one voice only. But what voice shall this be?\nSurely a voice which, amid all the tumult of self-seeking, shall whisper wholesome words into the\ndeafened ear, saying: \"You need not be envious of those whom the people call great and fortunate;\napplause need not disturb your composed attitude and your sanity of mind; you need not become\ndisgusted with your calm spirit because you see a great man, clothed in purple, protected by the\nwell-known symbols of authority; you need not judge the magistrate for whom the road is cleared to\nbe any happier than yourself, whom his officer pushes from the road. If you would wield a command\nthat is profitable to yourself, and injurious to nobody, clear your own faults out of the way. There are\nmany who set fire to cities, who storm garrisons that have remained impregnable for generations\nand safe for numerous ages, who raise mounds as high as the walls they are besieging, who with\nbattering-rams and engines shatter towers that have been reared to a wondrous height. There are\nmany who can send their columns ahead and press destructively upon the rear of the foe, who can\nreach the Great Sea dripping with the blood of nations; but even these men, before they could\nconquer their foe, were conquered by their own greed. No one withstood their attack; but they\nthemselves could not withstand desire for power and the impulse to cruelty; at the time when they\nseemed to be hounding others, they were themselves being hounded. Alexander was hounded into\nmisfortune and dispatched to unknown countries by a mad desire to lay waste other men's territory.\nDo you believe that the man was in his senses who could begin by devastating Greece, the land\nwhere he received his education? One who snatched away the dearest guerdon of each nation,\nbidding Spartans be slaves, and Athenians hold their tongues? Not content with the ruin of all the\nstates which Philip had either conquered or bribed into bondage, he overthrew various\ncommonwealths in various places and carried his weapons all over the world; his cruelty was tired,\nbut it never ceased ? like a wild beast that tears to pieces more than its hunger demands. Already\nhe has joined many kingdoms into one kingdom; already Greeks and Persians fear the same lord;\nalready nations Darius had left free submit to the yoke: yet he passes beyond the Ocean and the", "Sun, deeming it shame that he should shift his course of victory from the paths which Hercules and\nBacchus had trod; he threatens violence to Nature herself. He does not wish to go; but he cannot\nstay; he is like a weight that falls headlong, its course ending only when it lies motionless.", "It was not virtue or reason which persuaded Gnaeus Pompeius to take part in foreign and civil\nwarfare; it was his mad craving for unreal glory. Now he attacked Spain and the faction of Sertorius;\nnow he fared forth to enchain the pirates and subdue the seas. These were merely excuses and\npretexts for extending his power. What drew him into Africa, into the North, against Mithridates, into\nArmenia and all the corners of Asia? Assuredly it was his boundless desire to grow bigger; for only\nin his own eyes was he not great enough. And what impelled Gaius Caesar to the combined ruin of\nhimself and of the state? Renown, self-seeking, and the setting no limit to pre-eminence over all\nother men. He could not allow a single person to outrank him, although the state allowed two men to\nstand at its head. Do you think that Gaius Marius, who was once consul (he received this office on\none occasion, and stole it on all the others) courted all his perils by the inspiration of virtue when he\nwas slaughtering the Teutons and the Cimbri, and pursuing Jugurtha through the wilds of Africa?\nMarius commanded armies, ambition Marius.", "When such men as these were disturbing the world, they were themselves disturbed ? like cyclones\nthat whirl together what they have seized, but which are first whirled themselves and can for this\nreason rush on with all the greater force, having no control over themselves; hence, after causing\nsuch destruction to others, they feel in their own body the ruinous force which has enabled them to\ncause havoc to many. You need never believe that a man can become happy through the\nunhappiness of another. We must unravel all such cases as are forced before our eyes and\ncrammed into our ears; we must clear out our hearts, for they are full of evil talk. Virtue must be\nconducted into the place these have seized, ? a kind of virtue which may root out falsehood and\ndoctrines which contravene the truth, or may sunder us from the throng, in which we put too great\ntrust, and may restore us to the possession of sound opinions. For this is wisdom ? a return to\nNature and a restoration to the condition from which man's errors have driven us. It is a great part of\nhealth to have forsaken the counsellors of madness and to have fled far from a companionship that\nis mutually baneful.", "That you may know the truth of my remark, see how different is each individual's life before the\npublic from that of his inner self. A quiet life does not of itself give lessons in upright conduct; the\ncountryside does not of itself teach plain living; no, but when witnesses and onlookers are removed,\nfaults which ripen in publicity and display sink into the background. Who puts on the purple robe for\nthe sake of flaunting it in no man's eyes? Who uses gold plate when he dines alone? Who, as he\nflings himself down beneath the shadow of some rustic tree, displays in solitude the splendour of his\nluxury? No one makes himself elegant only for his own beholding, or even for the admiration of a\nfew friends or relatives. Rather does he spread out his well-appointed vices in proportion to the size\nof the admiring crowd. It is so: claqueurs and witnesses are irritants of all our mad foibles. You can\nmake us cease to crave, if you only make us cease to display. Ambition, luxury, and waywardness\nneed a stage to act upon; you will cure all those ills if you seek retirement.", "From my brother Severus, to love my kin, and to love truth, and to love justice; and through him I\nlearned to know Thrasea, Helvidius, Cato, Dion, Brutus; and from him I received the idea of a polity\nin which there is the same law for all, a polity administered with regard to equal rights and equal\nfreedom of speech, and the idea of a kingly government which respects most of all the freedom of\nthe governed; I learned from him also consistency and undeviating steadiness in my regard for\nphilosophy; and a disposition to do good, and to give to others readily, and to cherish good hopes,\nand to believe that I am loved by my friends; and in him I observed no concealment of his opinions\nwith respect to those whom he condemned, and that his friends had no need to conjecture what he\nwished or did not wish, but it was quite plain.", "Think of the universal substance, of which thou hast a very small portion; and of universal time, of\nwhich a short and indivisible interval has been assigned to thee; and of that which is fixed by\ndestiny, and how small a part of it thou art.", "Therefore, if our dwelling is situated amid the din of a city, there should be an adviser standing near\nus. When men praise great incomes, he should praise the person who can be rich with a slender\nestate and measures his wealth by the use he makes of it. In the face of those who glorify influence\nand power, he should of his own volition recommend a leisure devoted to study, and a soul which\nhas left the external and found itself. He should point out persons, happy in the popular estimation,\nwho totter on their envied heights of power, who are dismayed and hold a far different opinion of\nthemselves from what others hold of them. That which others think elevated, is to them a sheer\nprecipice. Hence they are frightened and in a flutter whenever they look down the abrupt steep of\ntheir greatness. For they reflect that there are various ways of falling and that the topmost point is\nthe most slippery. Then they fear that for which they strove, and the good fortune which made them\nweighty in the eyes of others weighs more heavily upon themselves. Then they praise easy leisure\nand independence; they hate the glamour and try to escape while their fortunes are still unimpaired.\nThen at last you may see them studying philosophy amid their fear, and hunting sound advice when\ntheir fortunes go awry. For these two things are, as it were, at opposite poles ? good fortune and\ngood sense; that is why we are wiser when in the midst of adversity. It is prosperity that takes away\nrighteousness. Farewell.", "You keep asking me to explain without postponement a topic which I once remarked should be put\noff until the proper time, and to inform you by letter whether this department of philosophy which the\nGreeks call paraenetic, and we Romans call the \"preceptorial,\" is enough to give us perfect wisdom.\nNow I know that you will take it in good part if I refuse to do so. But I accept your request all the\nmore willingly, and refuse to let the common saying lose its point:", "Don't ask for what you'll wish you hadn't got.\nFor sometimes we seek with effort that which we should decline if offered voluntarily. Call that\nfickleness or call it pettishness, ? we must punish the habit by ready compliance. There are many\nthings that we would have men think that we wish, but that we really do not wish. A lecturer\nsometimes brings upon the platform a huge work of research, written in the tiniest hand and very\nclosely folded; after reading off a large portion, he says: \"I shall stop, if you wish;\" and a shout\narises: \"Read on, read on!\" from the lips of those who are anxious for the speaker to hold his peace\nthen and there. We often want one thing and pray for another, not telling the truth even to the gods,\nwhile the gods either do not hearken, or else take pity on us. But I shall without pity avenge myself\nand shall load a huge letter upon your shoulders; for your part, if you read it with reluctance, you\nmay say: \"I brought this burden upon myself,\" and may class yourself among those men whose too\nambitious wives drive them frantic, or those whom riches harass, earned by extreme sweat of the\nbrow, or those who are tortured with the titles which they have sought by every sort of device and\ntoil, and all others who are responsible for their own misfortunes.", "But I must stop this preamble and approach the problem under consideration. Men say: \"The happy\nlife consists in upright conduct; precepts guide one to upright conduct; therefore precepts are\nsufficient for attaining the happy life.\" But they do not always guide us to upright conduct; this occurs\nonly when the will is receptive; and sometimes they are applied in vain, when wrong opinions\nobsess the soul. Furthermore, a man may act rightly without knowing that he is acting rightly. For\nnobody, except he be trained from the start and equipped with complete reason, can develop to\nperfect proportions, understanding when he should do certain things, and to what extent, and in\nwhose company, and how, and why. Without such training a man cannot strive with all his heart\nafter that which is honourable, or even with steadiness or gladness, but will ever be looking back\nand wavering.", "It is also said: \"If honourable conduct results from precepts, then precepts are amply sufficient for\nthe happy life; but the first of these statements is true; therefore the second is true also.\" We shall\nreply to these words that honourable conduct is, to be sure, brought about by precepts, but not by\nprecepts alone. \"Then,\" comes the reply, \"if the other arts are content with precepts, wisdom will\nalso be content therewith; for wisdom itself is an art of living. And yet the pilot is made by precepts\nwhich tell him thus and so to turn the tiller, set his sails, make use of a fair wind, tack, make the best\nof shifting and variable breezes ? all in the proper manner. Other craftsmen also are drilled by\nprecepts; hence precepts will be able to accomplish the same result in the case of our craftsman in\nthe art of living.\" Now all these arts are concerned with the tools of life, but not with life as a whole.\nHence there is much to clog these arts from without and to complicate them ? such as hope, greed,\nfear. But that art which professes to teach the art of life cannot be forbidden by any circumstance\nfrom exercising its functions; for it shakes off complications and pierces through obstacles. Would\nyou like to know how unlike its status is to the other arts? In the case of the latter, it is more\npardonable to err voluntarily rather than by accident; but in the case of wisdom the worst fault is to\ncommit sin wilfully. I mean something like this: A scholar will blush for shame, not if he makes a\ngrammatical blunder intentionally, but if he makes it unintentionally; if a physician does not\nrecognize that his patient is failing, he is a much poorer practitioner than if he recognizes the fact\nand conceals his knowledge. But in this art of living a voluntary mistake is the more shameful.", "Furthermore, many arts, aye and the most liberal of them all, have their special doctrines, and not\nmere precepts of advice ? the medical profession, for example. There are the different schools of\nHippocrates, of Asclepiades, of Themison. And besides, no art that concerns itself with theories can\nexist without its own doctrines; the Greeks call them dogmas, while we Romans may use the term\n\"doctrines,\" or \"tenets,\" or \"adopted principles,\" ? such as you will find in geometry or astronomy.\nBut philosophy is both theoretic and practical; it contemplates and at the same time acts. You are\nindeed mistaken if you think that philosophy offers you nothing but worldly assistance; her\naspirations are loftier than that. She cries: \"I investigate the whole universe, nor am I content,\nkeeping myself within a mortal dwelling, to give you favourable or unfavourable advice. Great\nmatters invite and such as are set far above you. In the words of Lucretius:", "And the gods, spreading before thine eyes\nThe atoms, ? whence all things are brought to birth,\nIncreased, and fostered by creative power,\nAnd eke their end when Nature casts them off.", "Philosophy, therefore, being theoretic, must have her doctrines. And why? Because no man can\nduly perform right actions except one who has been entrusted with reason, which will enable him, in\nall cases, to fulfil all the categories of duty. These categories he cannot observe unless he receives\nprecepts for every occasion, and not for the present alone. Precepts by themselves are weak and,\nso to speak, rootless if they be assigned to the parts and not to the whole. It is the doctrines which\nwill strengthen and support us in peace and calm, which will include simultaneously the whole of life\nand the\nuniverse in its completeness. There is the same difference between philosophical doctrines and\nprecepts as there is between elements and members; the latter depend upon the former, while the\nformer are the source both of the latter and of all things.", "People say: \"The old-style wisdom advised only what one should do and avoid; and yet the men of\nformer days were better men by far. When savants have appeared, sages have become rare. For\nthat frank, simple virtue has changed into hidden and crafty knowledge; we are taught how to\ndebate, not how to live.\" Of course, as you say, the old-fashioned wisdom, especially in its\nbeginnings, was crude; but so were the other arts, in which dexterity developed with progress. Nor\nindeed in those days was there yet any need for carefully-planned cures. Wickedness had not yet\nreached such a high point, or scattered itself so broadcast. Plain vices could be treated by plain\ncures; now, however, we need defences erected with all the greater care, because of the stronger\npowers by which we are attacked. Medicine once consisted of the knowledge of a few simples, to\nstop the flow of blood, or to heal wounds; then by degrees it reached its present stage of\ncomplicated variety. No wonder that in early days medicine had less to do! Men's bodies were still\nsound and strong; their food was light and not spoiled by art and luxury, whereas when they began\nto seek dishes not for the sake of removing, but of rousing, the appetite, and devised countless\nsauces to whet their gluttony, ? then what before was nourishment to a hungry man became a\nburden to the full stomach. Thence come paleness, and a trembling of wine-sodden muscles, and a\nrepulsive thinness, due rather to indigestion than to hunger. Thence weak tottering steps, and a\nreeling gait just like that of drunkenness. Thence dropsy, spreading under the entire skin, and the\nbelly growing to a paunch through an ill habit of taking more than it can hold. Thence yellow\njaundice, discoloured countenances, and bodies that rot inwardly, and fingers that grow knotty when\nthe joints stiffen, and muscles that are numbed and without power of feeling, and palpitation of the\nheart with its ceaseless pounding. Why need I mention dizziness? Or speak of pain in the eye and in\nthe ear, itching and aching in the fevered brain, and internal ulcers throughout the digestive system?\nBesides these, there are countless kinds of fever, some acute in their malignity, others creeping\nupon us with subtle damage, and still others which approach us with chills and severe ague. Why\nshould I mention the other innumerable diseases, the tortures that result from high living?", "Does another do me wrong? Let him look to it. He has his own disposition, his own activity. I now\nhave what the universal nature wills me to have; and I do what my nature now wills me to do.", "Men used to be free from such ills, because they had not yet slackened their strength by indulgence,\nbecause they had control over themselves, and supplied their own needs. They toughened their\nbodies by work and real toil, tiring themselves out by running or hunting or tilling the earth. They\nwere refreshed by food in which only a hungry man could take pleasure. Hence, there was no need\nfor all our mighty medical paraphernalia, for so many instruments and pill-boxes. For plain reasons\nthey enjoyed plain health; it took elaborate courses to produce elaborate diseases. Mark the number\nof things ? all to pass down a single throat ? that luxury mixes together, after ravaging land and sea.\nSo many different dishes must surely disagree; they are bolted with difficulty and are digested with\ndifficulty, each jostling against the other. And no wonder, that diseases which result from ill-assorted\nfood are variable and manifold; there must be an overflow when so many unnatural combinations\nare jumbled together. Hence there are as many ways of being ill as there are of living. The illustrious\nfounder of the guild and profession of medicine remarked that women never lost their hair or\nsuffered from pain in the feet; and yet nowadays they run short of hair and are afflicted with gout.\nThis does not mean that woman's physique has changed, but that it has been conquered; in rivalling\nmale indulgences they have also rivalled the ills to which men are heirs. They keep just as late\nhours, and drink just as much liquor; they challenge men in wrestling and carousing; they are no\nless given to vomiting from distended stomachs and to thus discharging all their wine again; nor are\nthey behind the men in gnawing ice, as a relief to their fevered digestions. And they even match the\nmen in their passions, although they were created to feel love passively (may the gods and\ngoddesses confound them!). They devise the most impossible varieties of unchastity, and in the\ncompany of men they play the part of men. What wonder, then, that we can trip up the statement of\nthe greatest and most skilled physician, when so many women are gouty and bald! Because of their\nvices, women have ceased to deserve the privileges of their sex; they have put off their womanly\nnature and are therefore condemned to suffer the diseases of men.", "Physicians of old time knew nothing about prescribing frequent nourishment and propping the feeble\npulse with wine; they did not understand the practice of blood-letting and of easing chronic\ncomplaints with sweat-baths; they did not understand how, by bandaging ankles and arms, to recall\nto the outward parts the hidden strength which had taken refuge in the centre. They were not\ncompelled to seek many varieties of relief, because the varieties of suffering were very few in\nnumber. Nowadays, however, to what a stage have the evils of ill-health advanced! This is the\ninterest which we pay on pleasures which we have coveted beyond what is reasonable and right.\nYou need not wonder that diseases are beyond counting: count the cooks! All intellectual interests\nare in abeyance; those who follow culture lecture to empty rooms, in out-of-the-way places. The\nhalls of the professor and the philosopher are deserted; but what a crowd there is in the caf\u00e9s! How\nmany young fellows besiege the kitchens of their gluttonous friends! I shall not mention the troops of\nluckless boys who must put up with other shameful treatment after the banquet is over. I shall not\nmention the troops of catamites, rated according to nation and colour, who must all have the same\nsmooth skin, and the same amount of youthful down on their cheeks, and the same way of dressing\ntheir hair, so that no boy with straight locks may get among the curly-heads. Nor shall I mention the\nmedley of bakers, and the numbers of waiters who at a given signal scurry to carry in the courses.\nYe gods! How many men are kept busy to humour a single belly! What? Do you imagine that those\nmushrooms, the epicure's poison, work no evil results in secret, even though they have had no\nimmediate effect? What? Do you suppose that your summer snow does not harden the tissue of the\nliver? What? Do you suppose that those oysters, a sluggish food fattened on slime, do not weigh\none down with mud-begotten heaviness? What? Do you not think that the so-called \"Sauce from the\nProvinces,\" the costly extract of poisonous fish, burns up the stomach with its salted putrefaction?\nWhat? Do you judge that the corrupted dishes which a man swallows almost burning from the\nkitchen fire, are quenched in the digestive system without doing harm? How repulsive, then, and\nhow unhealthy are their belchings, and how disgusted men are with themselves when they breathe\nforth the fumes of yesterday's debauch! You may be sure that their food is not being digested, but is", "I remember once hearing gossip about a notorious dish into which everything over which epicures\nlove to dally had been heaped together by a cookshop that was fast rushing into bankruptcy; there\nwere two kinds of mussels, and oysters trimmed round at the line where they are edible, set off at\nintervals by sea-urchins; the whole was flanked by mullets cut up and served without the bones. In\nthese days we are ashamed of separate foods; people mix many flavours into one. The dinner table\ndoes work which the stomach ought to do. I look forward next to food being served masticated! And\nhow little we are from it already when we pick out shells and bones and the cook performs the office\nof the teeth!", "They say: \"It is too much trouble to take our luxuries one by one; let us have everything served at\nthe same time and blended into the same flavour. Why should I help myself to a single dish? Let us\nhave many coming to the table at once; the dainties of various courses should be combined and\nconfounded. Those who used to declare that this was done for display and notoriety should\nunderstand that it is not done for show, but that it is an oblation to our sense of duty! Let us have at\none time, drenched in the same sauce, the dishes that are usually served separately. Let there be\nno difference: let oysters, sea-urchins, shell-fish, and mullets be mixed together and cooked in the\nsame dish.\" No vomited food could be jumbled up more helter-skelter. And as the food itself is\ncomplicated, so the resulting diseases are complex, unaccountable, manifold, variegated; medicine\nhas begun to campaign against them in many ways and by many rules of treatment.", "Now I declare to you that the same statement applies to philosophy. It was once more simple\nbecause men's sins were on a smaller scale, and could be cured with but slight trouble; in the face,\nhowever, of all this moral topsy-turvy men must leave no remedy untried. And would that this pest\nmight so at last be overcome! We are mad, not only individually, but nationally. We check\nmanslaughter and isolated murders; but what of war and the much-vaunted crime of slaughtering\nwhole peoples? There are no limits to our greed, none to our cruelty. And as long as such crimes\nare committed by stealth and by individuals, they are less harmful and less portentous; but cruelties\nare practised in accordance with acts of senate and popular assembly, and the public is bidden to\ndo that which is forbidden to the individual. Deeds that would be punished by loss of life when\ncommitted in secret, are praised by us because uniformed generals have carried them out. Man,\nnaturally the gentlest class of being, is not ashamed to revel in the blood of others, to wage war, and\nto entrust the waging of war to his sons, when even dumb beasts and wild beasts keep the peace\nwith one another. Against this overmastering and widespread madness philosophy has become a\nmatter of greater effort, and has taken on strength in proportion to the strength which is gained by\nthe opposition forces.", "It used to be easy to scold men who were slaves to drink and who sought out more luxurious food; it\ndid not require a mighty effort to bring the spirit back to the simplicity from which it had departed only\nslightly. But now", "Men seek pleasure from every source. No vice remains within its limits; luxury is precipitated into\ngreed. We are overwhelmed with forgetfulness of that which is honourable. Nothing that has an\nattractive value, is base. Man, an object of reverence in the eyes of man, is now slaughtered for jest\nand sport; and those whom it used to be unholy to train for the purpose of inflicting and enduring\nwounds, are thrust forth exposed and defenceless; and it is a satisfying spectacle to see a man\nmade a corpse.", "Amid this upset condition of morals, something stronger than usual is needed, ? something which\nwill shake off these chronic ills; in order to root out a deep-seated belief in wrong ideas, conduct\nmust be regulated by doctrines. It is only when we add precepts, consolation, and encouragement to\nthese, that they can prevail; by themselves they are ineffective. If we would hold men firmly bound\nand tear them away from the ills which clutch them fast, they must learn what is evil and what is\ngood. They must know that everything except virtue changes its name and becomes now good and\nnow bad. Just as the soldier's primary bond of union is his oath of allegiance and his love for the\nflag, and a horror of desertion, and just as, after this stage, other duties can easily be demanded of\nhim, and trusts given to him when once the oath has been administered; so it is with those whom\nyou would bring to the happy life: the first foundations must be laid, and virtue worked into these\nmen. Let them be held by a sort of superstitious worship of virtue; let them love her; let them desire\nto live with her, and refuse to live without her.", "\"But what, then,\" people say, \"have not certain persons won their way to excellence without\ncomplicated training? Have they not made great progress by obeying bare precepts alone?\" Very\ntrue; but their temperaments were propitious, and they snatched salvation as it were by the way. For\njust as the immortal gods did not learn virtue having been born with virtue complete, and containing\nin their nature the essence of goodness ? even so certain men are fitted with unusual qualities and\nreach without a long apprenticeship that which is ordinarily a matter of teaching, welcoming\nhonourable things as soon as they hear them. Hence come the choice minds which seize quickly\nupon virtue, or else produce it from within themselves. But your dull, sluggish fellow, who is\nhampered by his evil habits, must have this soul-rust incessantly rubbed off. Now, as the former\nsort, who are inclined towards the good, can be raised to the heights more quickly: so the weaker\nspirits will be assisted and freed from their evil opinions if we entrust to them the accepted principles\nof philosophy; and you may understand how essential these principles are in the following way.\nCertain things sink into us, rendering us sluggish in some ways, and hasty in others. These two\nqualities, the one of recklessness and the other of sloth, cannot be respectively checked or roused\nunless we remove their causes, which are mistaken admiration and mistaken fear. As long as we\nare obsessed by such feelings, you may say to us: \"You owe this duty to your father, this to your\nchildren, this to your friends, this to your guests\"; but greed will always hold us back, no matter how\nwe try. A man may know that he should fight for his country, but fear will dissuade him. A man may\nknow that he should sweat forth his last drop of energy on behalf of his friends, but luxury will forbid.\nA man may know that keeping a mistress is the worst kind of insult to his wife, but lust will drive him\nin the opposite direction. It will therefore be of no avail to give precepts unless you first remove the\nconditions that are likely to stand in the way of precepts; it will do no more good than to place\nweapons by your side and bring yourself near the foe without having your hands free to use those\nweapons. The soul, in order to deal with the precepts which we offer, must first be set free. Suppose\nthat a man is acting as he should; he cannot keep it up continuously or consistently, since he will not\nknow the reason for so acting. Some of his conduct will result rightly because of luck or practice; but", "there will be in his hand no rule by which he may regulate his acts, and which he may trust to tell\nhim whether that which he has done is right. One who is good through mere chance will not give\npromise of retaining such a character for ever. Furthermore, precepts will perhaps help you to do\nwhat should be done; but they will not help you to do it in the proper way; and if they do not help you\nto this end, they do not conduct you to virtue. I grant you that, if warned, a man will do what he\nshould; but that is not enough, since the credit lies, not in the actual deed, but in the way it is done.\nWhat is more shameful than a costly meal which eats away the income even of a knight? Or what so\nworthy of the censor's condemnation as to be always indulging oneself and one's \"inner man,\" if I\nmay speak as the gluttons do? And yet often has an inaugural dinner cost the most careful man a\ncool million! The very sum that is called disgraceful if spent on the appetite, is beyond reproach if\nspent for official purposes! For it is not luxury but an expenditure sanctioned by custom.", "Let the part of thy soul which leads and governs be undisturbed by the movements in the flesh,\nwhether of pleasure or of pain; and let it not unite with them, but let it circumscribe itself and limit\nthose affects to their parts. But when these affects rise up to the mind by virtue of that other\nsympathy that naturally exists in a body which is all one, then thou must not strive to resist the\nsensation, for it is natural: but let not the ruling part of itself add to the sensation the opinion that it is\neither good or bad.", "A mullet of monstrous size was presented to the Emperor Tiberius. They say it weighed four and\none half pounds (and why should I not tickle the palates of certain epicures by mentioning its\nweight?). Tiberius ordered it to be sent to the fish-market and put up for sale, remarking: \"I shall be\ntaken entirely by surprise, my friends, if either Apicius or P. Octavius does not buy that mullet.\" The\nguess came true beyond his expectation: the two men bid, and Octavius won, thereby acquiring a\ngreat reputation among his intimates because he had bought for five thousand sesterces a fish\nwhich the Emperor had sold, and which even Apicius did not succeed in buying. To pay such a price\nwas disgraceful for Octavius, but not for the individual who purchased the fish in order to present it\nto Tiberius, ? though I should be inclined to blame the latter as well; but at any rate he admired a gift\nof which he thought Caesar worthy.", "When people sit by the bedsides of their sick friends, we honour their motives. But when people do\nthis for the purpose of attaining a legacy, they are like vultures waiting for carrion. The same act may\nbe either shameful or honourable: the purpose and the manner make all the difference. Now each of\nour acts will be honourable if we declare allegiance to honour and judge honour and its results to be\nthe only good that can fall to man's lot; for other things are only temporarily good. I think, then, that\nthere should be deeply implanted a firm belief which will apply to life as a whole: this is what I call a\n\"doctrine.\" And as this belief is, so will be our acts and our thoughts. As our acts and our thoughts\nare, so will our lives be. It is not enough, when a man is arranging his existence as a whole, to give\nhim advice about details. Marcus Brutus, in the book which he has entitled Concerning Duty, gives\nmany precepts to parents, children, and brothers; but no one will do his duty as he ought, unless he\nhas some principle to which he may refer his conduct. We must set before our eyes the goal of the\nSupreme Good, towards which we may strive, and to which all our acts and words may have\nreference ? just as sailors must guide their course according to a certain star. Life without ideals is\nerratic: as soon as an ideal is to be set up, doctrines begin to be necessary. I am sure you will admit\nthat there is nothing more shameful than uncertain and wavering conduct, than the habit of timorous\nretreat. This will be our experience in all cases unless we remove that which checks the spirit and\nclogs it, and keeps it from making an attempt and trying with all its might.", "Precepts are commonly given as to how the gods should be worshipped. But let us forbid lamps to\nbe lighted on the Sabbath, since the gods do not need light, neither do men take pleasure in soot.\nLet us forbid men to offer morning salutation and to throng the doors of temples; mortal ambitions\nare attracted by such ceremonies, but God is worshipped by those who truly know Him. Let us forbid\nbringing towels and flesh-scrapers to Jupiter, and proffering mirrors to Juno; for God seeks no\nservants. Of course not; he himself does service to mankind, everywhere and to all he is at hand to\nhelp. Although a man hear what limit he should observe in sacrifice, and how far he should recoil\nfrom burdensome superstitions, he will never make sufficient progress until he has conceived a right\nidea of God, ? regarding Him as one who possesses all things, and allots all things, and bestows\nthem without price. And what reason have the gods for doing deeds of kindness? It is their nature.\nOne who thinks that they are unwilling to do harm, is wrong; they cannot do harm. They cannot\nreceive or inflict injury; for doing harm is in the same category as suffering harm. The universal\nnature, all-glorious and all-beautiful, has rendered incapable of inflicting ill those whom it has\nremoved from the danger of ill.", "The first way to worship the gods is to believe in the gods; the next to acknowledge their majesty, to\nacknowledge their goodness without which there is no majesty. Also, to know that they are supreme\ncommanders in the universe, controlling all things by their power and acting as guardians of the\nhuman race, even though they are sometimes unmindful of the individual. They neither give nor\nhave evil but they do chasten and restrain certain persons and impose penalties, and sometimes\npunish by bestowing that which seems good outwardly. Would you win over the gods? Then be a\ngood man. Whoever imitates them, is worshipping them sufficiently. Then comes the second\nproblem, ? how to deal with men. What is our purpose? What precepts do we offer? Should we bid\nthem refrain from bloodshed? What a little thing it is not to harm one whom you ought to help! It is\nindeed worthy of great praise, when man treats man with kindness! Shall we advise stretching forth\nthe hand to the shipwrecked sailor, or pointing out the way to the wanderer, or sharing a crust with\nthe starving? Yes, if I can only tell you first everything which ought to be afforded or withheld;\nmeantime, I can lay down for mankind a rule, in short compass, for our duties in human\nrelationships: all that you behold, that which comprises both god and man, is one ? we are the parts\nof one great body. Nature produced us related to one another, since she created us from the same\nsource and to the same end. She engendered in us mutual affection, and made us prone to\nfriendships. She established fairness and justice; according to her ruling, it is more wretched to\ncommit than to suffer injury. Through her orders, let our hands be ready for all that needs to be\nhelped. Let this verse be in your heart and on your lips:", "Let us possess things in common; for birth is ours in common. Our relations with one another are\nlike a stone arch, which would collapse if the stones did not mutually support each other, and which\nis upheld in this very way.", "Next, after considering gods and men, let us see how we should make use of things. It is useless for\nus to have mouthed out precepts, unless we begin by reflecting what opinion we ought to hold\nconcerning everything ? concerning poverty, riches, renown, disgrace, citizenship, exile. Let us\nbanish rumour and set a value upon each thing, asking what it is and not what it is called.", "Now let us turn to a consideration of the virtues. Some persons will advise us to rate prudence very\nhigh, to cherish bravery, and to cleave more closely, if possible, to justice than to all other qualities.\nBut this will do us no good if we do not know what virtue is, whether it is simple or compound,\nwhether it is one or more than one, whether its parts are separate or interwoven with one another;\nwhether he who has one virtue possesses the other virtues also; and just what are the distinctions\nbetween them. The carpenter does not need to inquire about his art in the light of its origin or of its\nfunction, any more than a pantomime need inquire about the art of dancing; if these arts understand\nthemselves, nothing is lacking, for they do not refer to life as a whole. But virtue means the\nknowledge of other things besides herself: if we would learn virtue we must learn all about virtue.\nConduct will not be right unless the will to act is right; for this is the source of conduct. Nor, again,\ncan the will be right without a right attitude of mind; for this is the source of the will. Furthermore,\nsuch an attitude of mind will not be found even in the best of men unless he has learned the laws of\nlife as a whole and has worked out a proper judgment about everything, and unless he has reduced\nfacts to a standard of truth. Peace of mind is enjoyed only by those who have attained a fixed and\nunchanging standard of judgment; the rest of mankind continually ebb and flow in their decisions,\nfloating in a condition where they alternately reject things and seek them. And what is the reason for\nthis tossing to and fro? It is because nothing is clear to them, because they make use of a most\nunsure criterion ? rumour. If you would always desire the same things, you must desire the truth. But\none cannot attain the truth without doctrines; for doctrines embrace the whole of life. Things good\nand evil, honourable and disgraceful, just and unjust, dutiful and undutiful, the virtues and their\npractice, the possession of comforts, worth and respect, health, strength, beauty, keenness of the\nsenses ? all these qualities call for one who is able to appraise them. One should be allowed to\nknow at what value every object is to be rated on the list; for sometimes you are deceived and\nbelieve that certain things are worth more than their real value; in fact, so badly are you deceived\nthat you will find you should value at a mere pennyworth those things which we men regard as worth\nmost of all ? for example, riches, influence, and power.", "You will never understand this unless you have investigated the actual standard by which such\nconditions are relatively rated. As leaves cannot flourish by their own efforts, but need a branch to\nwhich they may cling and from which they may draw sap, so your precepts, when taken alone,\nwither away; they must be grafted upon a school of philosophy. Moreover, those who do away with\ndoctrines do not understand that these doctrines are proved by the very arguments through which\nthey seem to disprove them. For what are these men saying? They are saying that precepts are\nsufficient to develop life, and that the doctrines of wisdom (in other words, dogmas) are superfluous.\nAnd yet this very utterance of theirs is a doctrine just as if I should now remark that one must\ndispense with precepts on the ground that they are superfluous, that one must make use of\ndoctrines, and that our studies should be directed solely towards this end; thus, by my very\nstatement that precepts should not be taken seriously, I should be uttering a precept. There are\ncertain matters in philosophy which need admonition; there are others which need proof, and a great\ndeal of proof, too, because they are complicated and can scarcely be made clear with the greatest\ncare and the greatest dialectic skill. If proofs are necessary, so are doctrines; for doctrines deduce\nthe truth by reasoning. Some matters are clear, and others are vague: those which the senses and\nthe memory can embrace are clear; those which are outside their scope are vague.", "But reason is not satisfied by obvious facts; its higher and nobler function is to deal with hidden\nthings. Hidden things need proof; proof cannot come without doctrines; therefore, doctrines are\nnecessary. That which leads to a general agreement, and likewise to a perfect one, is an assured\nbelief in certain facts; but if, lacking this assurance, all things are adrift in our minds, then doctrines\nare indispensable; for they give to our minds the means of unswerving decision. Furthermore, when\nwe advise a man to regard his friends as highly as himself, to reflect that an enemy may become a\nfriend, to stimulate love in the friend, and to check hatred in the enemy, we add: \"This is just and\nhonourable.\" Now the just and honourable element in our doctrines is embraced by reason; hence\nreason is necessary; for without it the doctrines cannot exist, either. But let us unite the two. For\nindeed branches are useless without their roots, and the roots themselves are strengthened by the\ngrowths which they have produced. Everyone can understand how useful the hands are; they\nobviously help us. But the heart, the source of the hands growth and power and motion, is hidden.\nAnd I can say the same thing about precepts: they are manifest, while the doctrines of wisdom are\nconcealed. And as only the initiated know the more hallowed portion of the rites, so in philosophy\nthe hidden truths are revealed only to those who are members and have been admitted to the\nsacred rites. But precepts and other such matters are familiar even to the uninitiated.", "Posidonius holds that not only precept-giving (there is nothing to prevent my using this word), but\neven persuasion, consolation, and encouragement, are necessary. To these he adds the\ninvestigation of causes (but I fail to see why I should not dare to call it aetiology, since the scholars\nwho mount guard over the Latin language thus use the term as having the right to do so). He\nremarks that it will also be useful to illustrate each particular virtue; this science Posidonius calls\nethology, while others call it characterization. It gives the signs and marks which belong to each\nvirtue and vice, so that by them distinction may be drawn between like things. Its function is the\nsame as that of precept. For he who utters precepts says: \"If you would have self-control, act thus\nand so!\" He who illustrates, says \"The man who acts thus and so, and refrains from certain other\nthings, possesses self-control.\" If you ask what the difference here is, I say that the one gives the\nprecepts of virtue, the other its embodiment. These illustrations, or, to use a commercial term, these\nsamples, have, I confess, a certain utility; just put them up for exhibition well recommended, and you\nwill find men to copy them. Would you, for instance, deem it a useful thing to have evidence given\nyou by which you may recognize a thoroughbred horse, and not be cheated in your purchase or\nwaste your time over a low-bred animal? But how much more useful it is to know the marks of a\nsurpassingly fine soul ? marks which one may appropriate from another for oneself!", "Live with the gods. And he does live with the gods who constantly shows to them, his own soul is\nsatisfied with that which is assigned to him, and that it does all that the daemon wishes, which Zeus\nhath given to every man for his guardian and guide, a portion of himself. And this is every man's\nunderstanding and reason.", "Straightway the foal of the high-bred drove, nursed up in the pastures,", "Marches with spirited step, and treads with a delicate motion;\nFirst on the dangerous pathway and into the threatening river,\nTrusting himself to the unknown bridge, without fear at its creakings,\nNeck thrown high in the air, and clear-cut head, and a belly\nSpare, back rounded, and breast abounding in courage and muscle.\nHe, when the clashing of weapons is heard to resound in the distance,\nLeaps from his place, and pricks up his ears, and all in a tremble\nPours forth the pent-up fire that lay close-shut in his nostrils.", "Vergil's description, though referring to something else, might perfectly well be the portrayal of a\nbrave man; at any rate, I myself should select no other simile for a hero. If I had to describe Cato,\nwho was unterrified amid the din of civil war, who was first to attack the armies that were already\nmaking for the Alps, who plunged face-forward into the civil conflict, this is exactly the sort of\nexpression and attitude which I should give him. Surely none could \"march with more spirited step\"\nthan one who rose against Caesar and Pompey at the same time and, when some were supporting\nCaesar's party and others that of Pompey, issued a challenge to both leaders, thus showing that the\nrepublic also had some backers. For it is not enough to say of Cato \"without fear at its creakings.\" Of\ncourse he is not afraid! He does not quail before real and imminent noises; in the face of ten legions,\nGallic auxiliaries, and a motley host of citizens and foreigners, he utters words fraught with freedom,\nencouraging the Republic not to fail in the struggle for freedom, but to try all hazards; he declares\nthat it is more honourable to fall into servitude than to fall in line with it. What force and energy are\nhis! What confidence he displays amid the general panic! He knows that he is the only one whose\nstanding is not in question, and that men do not ask whether Cato is free, but whether he is still\namong the free. Hence his contempt for danger and the sword. What a pleasure it is to say, in\nadmiration of the unflinching steadiness of a hero who did not totter when the whole state was in\nruins:", "It will be helpful not only to state what is the usual quality of good men, and to outline their figures\nand features, but also to relate and set forth what men there have been of this kind. We might\npicture that last and bravest wound of Cato's, through which Freedom breathed her last; or the wise\nLaelius and his harmonious life with his friend Scipio; or the noble deeds of the Elder Cato at home\nand abroad; or the wooden couches of Tubero, spread at a public feast, goatskins instead of\ntapestry, and vessels of earthenware set out for the banquet before the very shrine of Jupiter! What\nelse was this except consecrating poverty on the Capitol? Though I know no other deed of his for\nwhich to rank him with the Catos, is this one not enough? It was a censorship, not a banquet. How\nlamentably do those who covet glory fail to understand what glory is, or in what way it should be\nsought! On that day the Roman populace viewed the furniture of many men; it marvelled only at that\nof one! The gold and silver of all the others has been broken up and melted down times without\nnumber; but Tubero's earthenware will endure throughout eternity. Farewell.", "Spite of all do you still chafe and complain, not understanding that, in all the evils to which you refer,\nthere is really only one ? the fact that you do chafe and complain? If you ask me, I think that for a\nman there is no misery unless there be something in the universe which he thinks miserable. I shall\nnot endure myself on that day when I find anything unendurable.", "I am ill; but that is a part of my lot. My slaves have fallen sick, my income has gone off, my house is\nrickety, I have been assailed by losses, accidents, toil, and fear; this is a common thing. Nay, that\nwas an understatement; it was an inevitable thing. Such affairs come by order, and not by accident.\nIf you will believe me, it is my inmost emotions that I am just now disclosing to you: when everything\nseems to go hard and uphill, I have trained myself not merely to obey God, but to agree with His\ndecisions. I follow Him because my soul wills it, and not because I must. Nothing will ever happen to\nme that I shall receive with ill humour or with a wry face. I shall pay up all my taxes willingly. Now all\nthe things which cause us to groan or recoil, are part of the tax of life ? things, my dear Lucilius,\nwhich you should never hope and never seek to escape.", "It was disease of the bladder that made you apprehensive; downcast letters came from you; you\nwere continually getting worse; I will touch the truth more closely, and say that you feared for your\nlife. But come, did you not know, when you prayed for long life, that this was what you were praying\nfor? A long life includes all these troubles, just as a long journey includes dust and mud and rain.\n\"But,\" you cry, \"I wished to live, and at the same time to be immune from all ills.\" Such a womanish\ncry does no credit to a man. Consider in what attitude you shall receive this prayer of mine (I offer it\nnot only in a good, but in a noble spirit): \"May gods and goddesses alike forbid that Fortune keep\nyou in luxury!\" Ask yourself voluntarily which you would choose if some god gave you the choice ?\nlife in a caf\u00e9 or life in a camp.", "And yet life, Lucilius, is really a battle. For this reason those who are tossed about at sea, who\nproceed uphill and downhill over toilsome crags and heights, who go on campaigns that bring the\ngreatest danger, are heroes and front-rank fighters; but persons who live in rotten luxury and ease\nwhile others toil, are mere turtle-doves safe only because men despise them. Farewell.", "You are mistaken, my dear Lucilius, if you think that luxury, neglect of good manners, and other\nvices of which each man accuses the age in which he lives, are especially characteristic of our own\nepoch; no, they are the vices of mankind and not of the times. No era in history has ever been free\nfrom blame. Moreover, if you once begin to take account of the irregularities belonging to any\nparticular era, you will find ? to man's shame be it spoken ? that sin never stalked abroad more\nopenly than in Cato's very presence. Would anyone believe that money changed hands in the trial\nwhen Clodius was defendant on the charge of secret adultery with Caesar's wife, when he violated\nthe ritual of that sacrifice which is said to be offered on behalf of the people when all males are so\nrigorously removed outside the precinct, that even pictures of all male creatures are covered up?\nAnd yet, money was given to the jury, and, baser even than such a bargain, sexual crimes were\ndemanded of married women and noble youths as a sort of additional contribution. The charge\ninvolved less sin than the acquittal; for the defendant on a charge of adultery parcelled out the\nadulteries, and was not sure of his own safety until he had made the jury criminals like himself. All\nthis was done at the trial in which Cato gave evidence, although that was his sole part therein.", "Art thou angry with him whose armpits stink? Art thou angry with him whose mouth smells foul?\nWhat good will this danger do thee? He has such a mouth, he has such arm-pits: it is necessary that\nsuch an emanation must come from such things- but the man has reason, it will be said, and he is\nable, if he takes pain, to discover wherein he offends- I wish thee well of thy discovery. Well then,\nand thou hast reason: by thy rational faculty stir up his rational faculty; show him his error, admonish\nhim. For if he listens, thou wilt cure him, and there is no need of anger. Neither tragic actor nor\nwhore...", "I shall quote Cicero's actual words, because the facts are so bad as to pass belief: \"He made\nassignations, promises, pleas, and gifts. And more than this (merciful Heavens, what an abandoned\nstate of affairs!) upon several of the jury, to round out their reward, he even bestowed the enjoyment\nof certain women and meetings with noble youths.\" It is superfluous to be shocked at the bribe; the\nadditions to the bribe were worse. \"Will you have the wife of that prig, A.? Very good. Or of B., the\nmillionaire? I will guarantee that you shall lie with her. If you fail to commit adultery, condemn\nClodius. That beauty whom you desire shall visit you. I assure you a night in that woman's company\nwithout delay; my promise shall be carried out faithfully within the legal time of postponement.\" It\nmeans more to parcel out such crimes than to commit them; it means blackmailing dignified\nmatrons. These jurymen in the Clodius trial had asked the Senate for a guard ? a favour which\nwould have been necessary only for a jury about to convict the accused; and their request had been\ngranted. Hence the witty remark of Catulus after the defendant had been acquitted: \"Why did you\nask us for the guard? Were you afraid of having your money stolen from you?\" And yet, amid jests\nlike these he got off unpunished who before the trial was an adulterer, during the trial a pander, and\nwho escaped conviction more vilely than he deserved it.", "Do you believe that anything could be more disgraceful than such moral standards ? when lust\ncould not keep its hands either from religious worship or from the courts of law, when, in the very\ninquiry which was held in special session by order of the Senate, more crime was committed than\ninvestigated? The question at issue was whether one could be safe after committing adultery; it was\nshown that one could not be safe without committing adultery! All this bargaining took place in the\npresence of Pompey and Caesar, of Cicero and Cato, ? yes, that very Cato whose presence, it is\nsaid, caused the people to refrain from demanding the usual quips and cranks of naked actresses at\nthe Floralia, ? if you can believe that men were stricter in their conduct at a festival than in a\ncourt-room! Such things will be done in the future, as they have been done in the past; and the\nlicentiousness of cities will sometimes abate through discipline and fear, never of itself.", "Therefore, you need not believe that it is we who have yielded most to lust and least to law. For the\nyoung men of to-day live far more simple lives than those of an epoch when a defendant would\nplead not guilty to an adultery charge before his judges, and his judges admit it before the\ndefendant, when debauchery was practised to secure a verdict, and when Clodius, befriended by\nthe very vices of which he was guilty, played the procurer during the actual hearing of the case.\nCould one believe this? He to whom one adultery brought condemnation was acquitted because of\nmany. All ages will produce men like Clodius, but not all ages men like Cato. We degenerate easily,\nbecause we lack neither guides nor associates in our wickedness, and the wickedness goes on of\nitself, even without guides or associates. The road to vice is not only downhill, but steep; and many\nmen are rendered incorrigible by the fact that, while in all other crafts errors bring shame to good\ncraftsmen and cause vexation to those who go astray, the errors of life are a positive source of\npleasure. The pilot is not glad when his ship is thrown on her beam-ends; the physician is not glad\nwhen he buries his patient; the orator is not glad when the defendant loses a case through the fault\nof his advocate; but on the other hand every man enjoys his own crimes. A. delights in an intrigue ?\nfor it was the very difficulty which attracted him thereto. B. delights in forgery and theft, and is only\ndispleased with his sin when his sin has failed to hit the mark. And all this is the result of perverted\nhabits.", "Conversely, however, in order that you may know that there is an idea of good conduct present\nsubconsciously in souls which have been led even into the most depraved ways, and that men are\nnot ignorant of what evil is but indifferent ? I say that all men hide their sins, and, even though the\nissue be successful, enjoy the results while concealing the sins themselves. A good conscience,\nhowever, wishes to come forth and be seen of men; wickedness fears the very shadows. Hence I\nhold Epicurus's saying to be most apt: \"That the guilty may haply remain hidden is possible, that he\nshould be sure of remaining hidden is not possible,\" or, if you think that the meaning can be made\nmore clear in this way: \"The reason that it is no advantage to wrong-doers to remain hidden is that\neven though they have the good fortune they have not the assurance of remaining so.\" This is what I\nmean: crimes can be well guarded; free from anxiety they cannot be.", "This view, I maintain, is not at variance with the principles of our school, if it be so explained. And\nwhy? Because the first and worst penalty for sin is to have committed sin; and crime, though\nFortune deck it out with her favours, though she protect and take it in her charge, can never go\nunpunished; since the punishment of crime lies in the crime itself. But none the less do these\nsecond penalties press close upon the heels of the first ? constant fear, constant terror, and distrust\nin one's own security.", "Why, then, should I set wickedness free from such a punishment? Why should I not always leave it\ntrembling in the balance? Let us disagree with Epicurus on the one point, when he declares that\nthere is no natural justice, and that crime should be avoided because one cannot escape the fear\nwhich results therefrom; let us agree with him on the other ? that bad deeds are lashed by the whip\nof conscience, and that conscience is tortured to the greatest degree because unending anxiety\ndrives and whips it on, and it cannot rely upon the guarantors of its own peace of mind. For this,\nEpicurus, is the very proof that we are by nature reluctant to commit crime, because even in\ncircumstances of safety there is no one who does not feel fear. Good luck frees many men from\npunishment, but no man from fear. And why should this be if it were not that we have ingrained in us\na loathing for that which Nature has condemned? Hence even men who hide their sins can never\ncount upon remaining hidden; for their conscience convicts them and reveals them to themselves.\nBut it is the property of guilt to be in fear. It had gone ill with us, owing to the many crimes which\nescape the vengeance of the law and the prescribed punishments, were it not that those grievous\noffences against nature must pay the penalty in ready money, and that in place of suffering the\npunishment comes fear. Farewell.", "You need never believe that anyone who depends upon happiness is happy! It is a fragile support ?\nthis delight in adventitious things; the joy which entered from without will some day depart. But that\njoy which springs wholly from oneself is leal and sound; it increases and attends us to the last; while\nall other things which provoke the admiration of the crowd are but temporary Goods. You may reply:\n\"What do you mean? Cannot such things serve both for utility and for delight?\" Of course. But only if\nthey depend on us, and not we on them. All things that Fortune looks upon become productive and\npleasant, only if he who possesses them is in possession also of himself, and is not in the power of\nthat which belongs to him. For men make a mistake, my dear Lucilius, if they hold that anything\ngood, or evil either, is bestowed upon us by Fortune; it is simply the raw material of Goods and Ills\nthat she gives to us ? the sources of things which, in our keeping, will develop into good or ill. For\nthe soul is more powerful than any sort of Fortune; by its own agency it guides its affairs in either\ndirection, and of its own power it can produce a happy life, or a wretched one.", "A bad man makes everything bad ? even things which had come with the appearance of what is\nbest; but the upright and honest man corrects the wrongs of Fortune, and softens hardship and\nbitterness because he knows how to endure them; he likewise accepts prosperity with appreciation\nand moderation, and stands up against trouble with steadiness and courage. Though a man be\nprudent, though he conduct all his interests with well-balanced judgment, though he attempt nothing\nbeyond his strength, he will not attain the Good which is unalloyed and beyond the reach of threats,\nunless he is sure in dealing with that which is unsure. For whether you prefer to observe other men\n(and it is easier to make up one's mind when judging the affairs of others), or whether you observe\nyourself, with all prejudice laid aside, you will perceive and acknowledge that there is no utility in all\nthese desirable and beloved things, unless you equip yourself in opposition to the fickleness of\nchance and its consequences, and unless you repeat to yourself often and uncomplainingly, at\nevery mishap, the words: \"Heaven decreed it otherwise!\" Nay rather, to adopt a phrase which is\nbraver and nearer the truth ? one on which you may more safely prop your spirit ? say to yourself,\nwhenever things turn out contrary to your expectation: \"Heaven decreed better!\"", "If you are thus poised, nothing will affect you and a man will be thus poised if he reflects on the\npossible ups and downs in human affairs before he feels their force, and if he comes to regard\nchildren, or wife, or property, with the idea that he will not necessarily possess them always and that\nhe will not be any more wretched just because he ceases to possess them. It is tragic for the soul to\nbe apprehensive of the future and wretched in anticipation of wretchedness, consumed with an\nanxious desire that the objects which give pleasure may remain in its possession to the very end.\nFor such a soul will never be at rest; in waiting for the future it will lose the present blessings which it\nmight enjoy. And there is no difference between grief for something lost and the fear of losing it.", "But I do not for this reason advise you to be indifferent. Rather do you turn aside from you whatever\nmay cause fear. Be sure to foresee whatever can be foreseen by planning. Observe and avoid, long\nbefore it happens, anything that is likely to do you harm. To effect this your best assistance will be a\nspirit of confidence and a mind strongly resolved to endure all things. He who can bear Fortune, can\nalso beware of Fortune. At any rate, there is no dashing of billows when the sea is calm. And there\nis nothing more wretched or foolish than premature fear. What madness it is to anticipate one's\ntroubles! In fine, to express my thoughts in brief compass and portray to you those busybodies and\nself-tormentors ? they are as uncontrolled in the midst of their troubles as they are before them. He\nsuffers more than is necessary, who suffers before it is necessary; such men do not weigh the\namount of their suffering, by reason of the same failing which prevents them from being ready for it;\nand with the same lack of restraint they fondly imagine that their luck will last for ever, and fondly\nimagine that their gains are bound to increase as well as merely continue. They forget this\nspring-board on which mortal things are tossed, and they guarantee for themselves exclusively a\nsteady continuance of the gifts of chance.", "As thou intendest to live when thou art gone out,...so it is in thy power to live here. But if men do not\npermit thee, then get away out of life, yet so as if thou wert suffering no harm. The house is smoky,\nand I quit it. Why dost thou think that this is any trouble? But so long as nothing of the kind drives\nme out, I remain, am free, and no man shall hinder me from doing what I choose; and I choose to do\nwhat is according to the nature of the rational and social animal.", "For this very reason I regard as excellent the saying of Metrodorus, in a letter of consolation to his\nsister on the loss of her son, a lad of great promise: \"All the Good of mortals is mortal.\" He is\nreferring to those Goods towards which men rush in shoals. For the real Good does not perish; it is\ncertain and lasting and it consists of wisdom and virtue; it is the only immortal thing that falls to\nmortal lot. But men are so wayward, and so forgetful of their goal and of the point toward which\nevery day jostles them, that they are surprised at losing anything, although some day they are\nbound to lose everything. Anything of which you are entitled the owner is in your possession but is\nnot your own; for there is no strength in that which is weak, nor anything lasting and invincible in that\nwhich is frail. We must lose our lives as surely as we lose our property, and this, if we understand\nthe truth, is itself a consolation. Lose it with equanimity; for you must lose your life also.", "What resource do we find, then, in the face of these losses? Simply this ? to keep in memory the\nthings we have lost, and not to suffer the enjoyment which we have derived from them to pass away\nalong with them. To have may be taken from us, to have had, never. A man is thankless in the\nhighest degree if, after losing something, he feels no obligation for having received it. Chance robs\nus of the thing, but leaves us its use and its enjoyment ? and we have lost this if we are so unfair as\nto regret. Just say to yourself: \"Of all these experiences that seem so frightful, none is insuperable.\nSeparate trials have been overcome by many: fire by Mucius, crucifixion by Regulus, poison by\nSocrates, exile by Rutilius, and a sword-inflicted death by Cato; therefore, let us also overcome\nsomething.\" Again, those objects which attract the crowd under the appearance of beauty and\nhappiness, have been scorned by many men and on many occasions. Fabricius when he was\ngeneral refused riches, and when he was censor branded them with disapproval. Tubero deemed\npoverty worthy both of himself and of the deity on the Capitol when, by the use of earthenware\ndishes at a public festival, he showed that man should be satisfied with that which the gods could\nstill use. The elder Sextius rejected the honours of office; he was born with an obligation to take part\nin public affairs, and yet would not accept the broad stripe even when the deified Julius offered it to\nhim. For he understood that what can be given can also be taken away.", "Let us also, therefore, carry out some courageous act of our own accord; let us be included among\nthe ideal types of history. Why have we been slack? Why do we lose heart? That which could be\ndone, can be done, if only we purify our souls and follow Nature; for when one strays away from\nNature one is compelled to crave, and fear, and be a slave to the things of chance. We may return\nto the true path; we may be restored to our proper state; let us therefore be so, in order that we may\nbe able to endure pain, in whatever form it attacks our bodies, and say to Fortune: \"You have to deal\nwith a man; seek someone whom you can conquer!\"", "By these words, and words of a like kind, the malignity of the ulcer is quieted down; and I hope\nindeed that it can be reduced, and either cured or brought to a stop, and grow old along with the\npatient himself. I am, however, comfortable in my mind regarding him; what we are now discussing\nis our own loss ? the taking-off of a most excellent old man. For he himself has lived a full life, and\nanything additional may be craved by him, not for his own sake, but for the sake of those who need\nhis services. In continuing to live, he deals generously. Some other person might have put an end to\nthese sufferings; but our friend considers it no less base to flee from death than to flee towards\ndeath. \"But,\" comes the answer, \"if circumstances warrant, shall he not take his departure?\" Of\ncourse, if he can no longer be of service to anyone, if all his business will be to deal with pain. This,\nmy dear Lucilius, is what we mean by studying philosophy while applying it, by practising it on truth ?\nnote what courage a prudent man possesses against death, or against pain, when the one\napproaches and the other weighs heavily. What ought to be done must be learned from one who\ndoes it. Up to now we have dealt with arguments ? whether any man can resist pain, or whether the\napproach of death can cast down even great souls. Why discuss it further? Here is an immediate\nfact for us to tackle ? death does not make our friend braver to face pain, nor pain to face death.\nRather does he trust himself in the face of both; he does not suffer with resignation because he\nhopes for death, nor does he die gladly because he is tired of suffering. Pain he endures, death he\nawaits. Farewell.", "I enclose a copy of the letter which I wrote to Marullus at the time when he had lost his little son and\nwas reported to be rather womanish in his grief ? a letter in which I have not observed the usual\nform of condolence: for I did not believe that he should be handled gently, since in my opinion he\ndeserved criticism rather than consolation. When a man is stricken and is finding it most difficult to\nendure a grievous wound, one must humour him for a while; let him satisfy his grief or at any rate\nwork off the first shock; but those who have assumed an indulgence in grief should be rebuked\nforthwith, and should learn that there are certain follies even in tears.", "\"Is it solace that you look for? Let me give you a scolding instead! You are like a woman in the way\nyou take your son's death; what would you do if you had lost an intimate friend? A son, a little child\nof unknown promise, is dead; a fragment of time has been lost. We hunt out excuses for grief; we\nwould even utter unfair complaints about Fortune, as if Fortune would never give us just reason for\ncomplaining! But I had really thought that you possessed spirit enough to deal with concrete\ntroubles, to say nothing of the shadowy troubles over which men make moan through force of habit.\nHad you lost a friend (which is the greatest blow of all), you would have had to endeavour rather to\nrejoice because you had possessed him than to mourn because you had lost him.", "\"But many men fail to count up how manifold their gains have been, how great their rejoicings. Grief\nlike yours has this among other evils: it is not only useless, but thankless. Has it then all been for\nnothing that you have had such a friend? During so many years, amid such close associations, after\nsuch intimate communion of personal interests, has nothing been accomplished? Do you bury\nfriendship along with a friend? And why lament having lost him, if it be of no avail to have possessed\nhim? Believe me, a great part of those we have loved, though chance has removed their persons,\nstill abides with us. The past is ours, and there is nothing more secure for us than that which has\nbeen. We are ungrateful for past gains, because we hope for the future, as if the future ? if so be\nthat any future is ours ? will not be quickly blended with the past. People set a narrow limit to their\nenjoyments if they take pleasure only in the present; both the future and the past serve for our\ndelight ? the one with anticipation, and the other with memories but the one is contingent and may\nnot come to pass, while the other must have been.", "\"What madness it is, therefore, to lose our grip on that which is the surest thing of all? Let us rest\ncontent with the pleasures we have quaffed in past days, if only, while we quaffed them, the soul\nwas not pierced like a sieve, only to lose again whatever it had received. There are countless cases\nof men who have without tears buried sons in the prime of manhood ? men who have returned from\nthe funeral pyre to the Senate chamber, or to any other official duties, and have straightway busied\nthemselves with something else. And rightly; for in the first place it is idle to grieve if you get no help\nfrom grief. In the second place, it is unfair to complain about what has happened to one man but is\nin store for all. Again, it is foolish to lament one's loss, when there is such a slight interval between\nthe lost and the loser. Hence we should be more resigned in spirit, because we follow closely those\nwhom we have lost.", "\"Note the rapidity of Time ? that swiftest of things; consider the shortness of the course along which\nwe hasten at top speed; mark this throng of humanity, all straining toward the same point with\nbriefest intervals between them ? even when they seem longest; he whom you count as passed\naway has simply posted on ahead. And what is more irrational than to bewail your predecessor,\nwhen you yourself must travel on the same journey? Does a man bewail an event which he knew\nwould take place? Or, if he did not think of death as man's lot, he has but cheated himself. Does a\nman bewail an event which he has been admitting to be unavoidable? Whoever complains about the\ndeath of anyone, is complaining that he was a man. Everyone is bound by the same terms: he who\nis privileged to be born, is destined to die. Periods of time separate us, but death levels us. The\nperiod which lies between our first day and our last is shifting and uncertain: if you reckon it by its\ntroubles, it is long even to a lad, if by its speed, it is scanty even to a greybeard. Everything is\nslippery, treacherous, and more shifting than any weather. All things are tossed about and shift into\ntheir opposites at the bidding of Fortune; amid such a turmoil of mortal affairs nothing but death is\nsurely in store for anyone. And yet all men complain about the one thing wherein none of them is\ndeceived. 'But he died in boyhood.' I am not yet prepared to say that he who quickly comes to the\nend of his life has the better of the bargain; let us turn to consider the case of him who has grown to\nold age. How very little is he superior to the child! Place before your mind's eye the vast spread of\ntime's abyss, and consider the universe; and then contrast our so-called human life with infinity: you\nwill then see how scant is that for which we pray, and which we seek to lengthen. How much of this\ntime is taken up with weeping, how much with worry! How much with prayers for death before death\narrives, how much with our health, how much with our fears! How much is occupied by our years of\ninexperience or of useless endeavour! And half of all this time is wasted in sleeping. Add, besides,\nour toils, our griefs, our dangers ? and you will comprehend that even in the longest life real living is\nthe least portion thereof. Nevertheless, who will make such an admission as: 'A man is not better off\nwho is allowed to return home quickly, whose journey is accomplished before he is wearied out'?\nLife is neither a Good nor an Evil; it is simply the place where good and evil exist. Hence this little", "boy has lost nothing except a hazard where loss was more assured than gain. He might have turned\nout temperate and prudent; he might, with your fostering care, have been moulded to a better\nstandard; but (and this fear is more reasonable) he might have become just like the many. Note the\nyouths of the noblest lineage whose extravagance has flung them into the arena; note those men\nwho cater to the passions of themselves and others in mutual lust, whose days never pass without\ndrunkenness or some signal act of shame; it will thus be clear to you that there was more to fear\nthan to hope for.", "\"For this reason you ought not to invite excuses for grief or aggravate slight burdens by getting\nindignant. I am not exhorting you to make an effort and rise to great heights; for my opinion of you is\nnot so low as to make me think that it is necessary for you to summon every bit of your virtue to face\nthis trouble. Yours is not pain; it is a mere sting ? and it is you yourself who are turning it into pain.", "The intelligence of the universe is social. Accordingly it has made the inferior things for the sake of\nthe superior, and it has fitted the superior to one another. Thou seest how it has subordinated,\nco-ordinated and assigned to everything its proper portion, and has brought together into concord\nwith one another the things which are the best.", "\"Of a surety philosophy has done you much service if you can bear courageously the loss of a boy\nwho was as yet better known to his nurse than to his father! And what, then? Now, at this time, am I\nadvising you to be hard-hearted, desiring you to keep your countenance unmoved at the very\nfuneral ceremony, and not allowing your soul even to feel the pinch of pain? By no means. That\nwould mean lack of feeling rather than virtue ? to behold the burial ceremonies of those near and\ndear to you with the same expression as you beheld their living forms, and to show no emotion over\nthe first bereavement in your family. But suppose that I forbade you to show emotion; there are\ncertain feelings which claim their own rights. Tears fall, no matter how we try to check them, and by\nbeing shed they ease the soul. What, then, shall we do? Let us allow them to fall, but let us not\ncommand them do so; let us weep according as emotion floods our eyes, but not as much as mere\nimitation shall demand. Let us, indeed, add nothing to natural grief, nor augment it by following the\nexample of others. The display of grief makes more demands than grief itself: how few men are sad\nin their own company! They lament the louder for being heard; persons who are reserved and silent\nwhen alone are stirred to new paroxysms of tears when they behold others near them! At such times\nthey lay violent hands upon their own persons, ? though they might have done this more easily if no\none were present to check them; at such times they pray for death; at such times they toss\nthemselves from their couches. But their grief slackens with the departure of onlookers. In this\nmatter, as in others also, we are obsessed by this fault ? conforming to the pattern of the many, and\nregarding convention rather than duty. We abandon nature and surrender to the mob ? who are\nnever good advisers in anything, and in this respect as in all others are most inconsistent. People\nsee a man who bears his grief bravely: they call him undutiful and savage-hearted; they see a man\nwho collapses and clings to his dead: they call him womanish and weak. Everything, therefore,\nshould be referred to reason. But nothing is more foolish than to court a reputation for sadness and\nto sanction tears; for I hold that with a wise man some tears fall by consent, others by their own\nforce.", "\"I shall explain the difference as follows: When the first news of some bitter loss has shocked us,\nwhen we embrace the form that will soon pass from our arms to the funeral flames ? then tears are\nwrung from us by the necessity of Nature, and the life-force, smitten by the stroke of grief, shakes\nboth the whole body, and the eyes also, from which it presses out and causes to flow the moisture\nthat lies within. Tears like these fall by a forcing-out process, against our will; but different are the\ntears which we allow to escape when we muse in memory upon those whom we have lost. And\nthere is in them a certain sweet sadness when we remember the sound of a pleasant voice, a genial\nconversation, and the busy duties of yore; at such a time the eyes are loosened, as it were, with joy.\nThis sort of weeping we indulge; the former sort overcomes us.", "\"There is, then, no reason why, just because a group of persons is standing in your presence or\nsitting at your side, you should either check or pour forth your tears; whether restrained or\noutpoured, they are never so disgraceful as when feigned. Let them flow naturally. But it is possible\nfor tears to flow from the eyes of those who are quiet and at peace. They often flow without\nimpairing the influence of the wise man ? with such restraint that they show no want either of feeling\nor of self-respect. We may, I assure you, obey Nature and yet maintain our dignity. I have seen men\nworthy of reverence, during the burial of those near and dear, with countenances upon which love\nwas written clear even after the whole apparatus of mourning was removed, and who showed no\nother conduct than that which was allowed to genuine emotion. There is a comeliness even in grief.\nThis should be cultivated by the wise man; even in tears, just as in other matters also, there is a\ncertain sufficiency; it is with the unwise that sorrows, like joys, gush over.", "\"Accept in an unruffled spirit that which is inevitable. What can happen that is beyond belief? Or\nwhat that is new? How many men at this very moment are making arrangements for funerals! How\nmany are purchasing grave-clothes! How many are mourning, when you yourself have finished\nmourning! As often as you reflect that your boy has ceased to be, reflect also upon man, who has no\nsure promise of anything, whom Fortune does not inevitably escort to the confines of old age, but\nlets him go at whatever point she sees fit. You may, however, speak often concerning the departed,\nand cherish his memory to the extent of your power. This memory will return to you all the more\noften if you welcome its coming without bitterness; for no man enjoys converse with one who is\nsorrowful, much less with sorrow itself. And whatever words, whatever jests of his, no matter how\nmuch of a child he was, may have given you pleasure to hear ? these I would have you recall again\nand again; assure yourself confidently that he might have fulfilled the hopes which you, his father,\nhad entertained. Indeed, to forget the beloved dead, to bury their memory along with their bodies, to\nbewail them bounteously and afterwards think of them but scantily ? this is the mark of a soul below\nthat of man. For that is the way in which birds and beasts love their young; their affection is quickly\nroused and almost reaches madness, but it cools away entirely when its object dies. This quality\ndoes not befit a man of sense; he should continue to remember, but should cease to mourn. And in\nno wise do I approve of the remark of Metrodorus ? that there is a certain pleasure akin to sadness,\nand that one should give chase thereto at such times as these. I am quoting the actual words of\nMetrodorus I have no doubt what your feelings will be in these matters; for what is baser than to\n'chase after' pleasure in the very midst of mourning ? nay rather by means of mourning ? and even\namid one's tears to hunt out that which will give pleasure? These are the men who accuse us of too\ngreat strictness, slandering our precepts because of supposed harshness ? because (say they) we\ndeclare that grief should either not be given place in the soul at all, or else should be driven out\nforthwith. But which is the more incredible or inhuman ? to feel no grief at the loss of one's friend, or\nto go a-hawking after pleasure in the midst of grief? That which we Stoics advise, is honourable;\nwhen emotion has prompted a moderate flow of tears, and has, so to speak, ceased to effervesce,", "the soul should not be surrendered to grief. But what do you mean, Metrodorus, by saying that with\nour very grief there should be a blending of pleasure? That is the sweetmeat method of pacifying\nchildren; that is the way we still the cries of infants, by pouring milk down their throats!", "\"Even at the moment when your son's body is on the pyre, or your friend breathing his last, will you\nnot suffer your pleasure to cease, rather than tickle your very grief with pleasure? Which is the more\nhonourable ? to remove grief from your soul, or to admit pleasure even into the company of grief?\nDid I say 'admit'? Nay, I mean 'chase after,' and from the hands, too, of grief itself. Metrodorus says:\n'There is a certain pleasure which is related to sadness.' We Stoics may say that, but you may not.\nThe only Good which you recognize, is pleasure, and the only Evil, pain; and what relationship can\nthere be between a Good and an Evil? But suppose that such a relationship does exist; now, of all\ntimes, is it to be rooted out? Shall we examine grief also, and see with what elements of delight and\npleasure it is surrounded? Certain remedies, which are beneficial for some parts of the body, cannot\nbe applied to other parts because these are, in a way, revolting and unfit; and that which in certain\ncases would work to a good purpose without any loss to one's self-respect, may become unseemly\nbecause of the situation of the wound. Are you not, similarly, ashamed to cure sorrow by pleasure?\nNo, this sore spot must be treated in a more drastic way. This is what you should preferably advise:\nthat no sensation of evil can reach one who is dead; for if it can reach him, he is not dead. And I say\nthat nothing can hurt him who is as naught; for if a man can be hurt, he is alive. Do you think him to\nbe badly off because he is no more, or because he still exists as somebody? And yet no torment\ncan come to him from the fact that he is no more ? for what feeling can belong to one who does not\nexist? ? nor from the fact that he exists; for he has escaped the greatest disadvantage that death\nhas in it ? namely, non-existence.", "\"Let us say this also to him who mourns and misses the untimely dead: that all of us, whether young\nor old, live, in comparison with eternity, on the same level as regards our shortness of life. For out of\nall time there comes to us less than what any one could call least, since 'least' is at any rate some\npart; but this life of ours is next to nothing, and yet (fools that we are!), we marshal it in broad array!", "\"These words I have written to you, not with the idea that you should expect a cure from me at such\na late date ? for it is clear to me that you have told yourself everything that you will read in my letter\n? but with the idea that I should rebuke you even for the slight delay during which you lapsed from\nyour true self, and should encourage you for the future, to rouse your spirit against Fortune and to\nbe on the watch for all her missiles, not as if they might possibly come, but as if they were bound to\ncome.\" Farewell.", "You write me that you have read with the greatest eagerness the work by Fabianus Papirius entitled\nThe Duties of a Citizen, and that it did not come up to your expectations; then, forgetting that you\nare dealing with a philosopher, you proceed to criticize his style.", "Suppose, now, that your statement is true ? that he pours forth rather than places his words; let me,\nhowever, tell you at the start that this trait of which you speak has a peculiar charm, and that it is a\ngrace appropriate to a smoothly-gliding style. For, I maintain, it matters a great deal whether it\ntumbles forth, or flows along. Moreover, there is a deal of difference in this regard also ? as I shall\nmake clear to you: Fabianus seems to me to have not so much an \"efflux\" as a \"flow\" of words: so\ncopious is it, without confusion, and yet not without speed. This is indeed what his style declares\nand announces ? that he has not spent a long time in working his matter over and twisting it into\nshape. But even supposing the facts are as you would have them; the man was building up\ncharacter rather than words, and was writing those words for the mind rather than for the ear.\nBesides, had he been speaking them in his own person, you would not have had time to consider\nthe details ? the whole work would have so swept you along. For as a rule that which pleases by its\nswiftness is of less value when taken in hand for reading.", "Nevertheless, this very quality, too, of attracting at first sight is a great advantage, no matter whether\ncareful investigation may discover something to criticize. If you ask me, I should say that he who has\nforced approval is greater than he who has earned it; and yet I know that the latter is safer, I know\nthat he can give more confident guarantees for the future. A meticulous manner of writing does not\nsuit the philosopher; if he is timid as to words, when will he ever be brave and steadfast, when will\nhe ever really show his worth? Fabianus's style was not careless, it was assured. That is why you\nwill find nothing shoddy in his work: his words are well chosen and yet not hunted for; they are not\nunnaturally inserted and inverted, according to the present-day fashion; but they possess distinction,\neven though they are taken from ordinary speech. There you have honourable and splendid ideas,\nnot fettered into aphorisms, but spoken with greater freedom. We shall of course notice passages\nthat are not sufficiently pruned, not constructed with sufficient care, and lacking the polish which is in\nvogue nowadays; but after regarding the whole, you will see that there are no futile subtleties of\nargument. There may, doubtless, be no variety of marbles, no water-supply which flows from one\napartment to another, no \"pauper-rooms,\" or any other device that luxury adds when ill content with\nsimple charms; but, in the vulgar phrase, it is \"a good house to live in.\"", "How hast thou behaved hitherto to the gods, thy parents, brethren, children, teachers, to those who\nlooked after thy infancy, to thy friends, kinsfolk, to thy slaves? Consider if thou hast hitherto behaved\nto all in such a way that this may be said of thee:", "Furthermore, opinions vary with regard to the style. Some wish it to be polished down from all\nroughness; and some take so great a pleasure in the abrupt manner that they would intentionally\nbreak up any passage which may by chance spread itself out more smoothly, scattering the closing\nwords in such a way that the sentences may result unexpectedly. Read Cicero: his style has unity; it\nmoves with a modulated pace, and is gentle without being degenerate. The style of Asinius Pollio,\non the other hand, is \"bumpy,\" jerky, leaving off when you least expect it. And finally, Cicero always\nstops gradually; while Pollio breaks off, except in the very few cases where he cleaves to a definite\nrhythm and a single pattern.", "In addition to this, you say that everything in Fabianus seems to you commonplace and lacking in\nelevation; but I myself hold that he is free from such a fault. For that style of his is not commonplace,\nbut simply calm and adjusted to his peaceful and well-ordered mind ? not on a low level but on an\neven plane. There is lacking the verve and spur of the orator (for which you are looking), and a\nsudden shock of epigrams. But look, please, at the whole work, how well-ordered it is: there is a\ndistinction in it. His style does not possess, but will suggest, dignity.", "Mention someone whom you may rank ahead of Fabianus. Cicero, let us say, whose books on\nphilosophy are almost as numerous as those of Fabianus. I will concede this point; but it is no slight\nthing to be less than the greatest. Or Asinius Pollio, let us say. I will yield again, and content myself\nby replying: \"It is a distinction to be third in so great a field.\" You may also include Livy; for Livy\nwrote both dialogues (which should be ranked as history no less than as philosophy), and works\nwhich professedly deal with philosophy. I shall yield in the case of Livy also. But consider how many\nwriters Fabianus outranks, if he is surpassed by three only ? and those three the greatest masters of\neloquence!", "But, it may be said, he does not offer everything: though his style is elevated, it is not strong; though\nit flows forth copiously, it lacks force and sweep; it is not translucent, but it is lucid. \"One would fail,\"\nyou urge, \"to find therein any rugged denunciation of vice, any courageous words in the face of\ndanger, any proud defiance of Fortune, any scornful threats against self-seeking. I wish to see\nluxury rebuked, lust condemned, waywardness crushed out. Let him show us the keenness of\noratory, the loftiness of tragedy, the subtlety of comedy.\" You wish him to rely on that pettiest of\nthings, phraseology; but he has sworn allegiance to the greatness of his subject and draws\neloquence after him as a sort of shadow, but not of set purpose.", "Our author will doubtless not investigate every detail, nor subject it to analysis, nor inspect and\nemphasize each separate word. This I admit. Many phrases will fall short, or will fail to strike home,\nand at times the style will slip along indolently; but there will be plenty of light throughout the work;\nthere will be long stretches which will not weary the reader. And, finally, he will offer this quality of\nmaking it clear to you that he meant what he wrote. You will understand that his aim was to have\nyou know what pleased him, rather than that he should please you. All his work makes for progress\nand for sanity, without any search for applause.", "I do not doubt that his writings are of the kind I have described, although I am harking back to him\nrather than retaining a sure memory of him, and although the general tone of his writings remains in\nmy mind, not from a careful and recent perusal, but in outline, as is natural after an acquaintance of\nlong ago. But certainly, whenever I heard him lecture, such did his work seem to me ? not solid but\nfull, the kind which would inspire young men of promise and rouse their ambition to become like him,\nwithout making them hopeless of surpassing him; and this method of encouragement seems to me\nthe most helpful of all. For it is disheartening to inspire in a man the desire, and to take away from\nhim the hope, of emulation. At any rate, his language was fluent, and though one might not approve\nevery detail, the general effect was noble. Farewell.", "Every day and every hour reveal to us what a nothing we are, and remind us with some fresh\nevidence that we have forgotten our weakness; then, as we plan for eternity, they compel us to look\nover our shoulders at Death.", "Do you ask me what this preamble means? It refers to Cornelius Senecio, a distinguished and\ncapable Roman knight, whom you knew: from humble beginnings he had advanced himself to\nfortune, and the rest of the path already lay downhill before him. For it is easier to grow in dignity\nthan to make a start; and money is very slow to come where there is poverty; until it can creep out of\nthat, it goes halting. Senecio was already bordering upon wealth, helped in that direction by two very\npowerful assets ? knowing how to make money and how to keep it also; either one of these gifts\nmight have made him a rich man. Here was a person who lived most simply, careful of health and\nwealth alike. He had, as usual, called upon me early in the morning, and had then spent the whole\nday, even up to nightfall, at the bedside of a friend who was seriously and hopelessly ill. After a\ncomfortable dinner, he was suddenly seized with an acute attack of quinsy, and, with the breath\nclogged tightly in his swollen throat, barely lived until daybreak. So within a very few hours after the\ntime when he had been performing all the duties of a sound and healthy man, he passed away. He\nwho was venturing investments by land and sea, who had also entered public life and left no type of\nbusiness untried, during the very realization of financial success and during the very onrush of the\nmoney that flowed into his coffers, was snatched from the world!", "Never has wronged a man in deed or word. And call to recollection both how many things thou hast\npassed through, and how many things thou hast been able to endure: and that the history of thy life\nis now complete and thy service is ended: and how many beautiful things thou hast seen: and how\nmany pleasures and pains thou hast despised; and how many things called honourable thou hast\nspurned; and to how many ill-minded folks thou hast shown a kind disposition.", "Graft now thy pears, Meliboeus, and set out thy vines in their order!", "But how foolish it is to set out one's life, when one is not even owner of the morrow! O what\nmadness it is to plot out far-reaching hopes! To say: \"I will buy and build, loan and call in money, win\ntitles of honour, and then, old and full of years, I will surrender myself to a life of ease.\" Believe me\nwhen I say that everything is doubtful, even for those who are prosperous. No one has any right to\ndraw for himself upon the future. The very thing that we grasp slips through our hands, and chance\ncuts into the actual hour which we are crowding so full. Time does indeed roll along by fixed law, but\nas in darkness; and what is it to me whether Nature's course is sure, when my own is unsure?", "We plan distant voyages and long-postponed home-comings after roaming over foreign shores, we\nplan for military service and the slow rewards of hard campaigns, we canvass for governorships and\nthe promotions of one office after another ? and all the while death stands at our side; but since we\nnever think of it except as it affects our neighbour, instances of mortality press upon us day by day,\nto remain in our minds only as long as they stir our wonder.", "Yet what is more foolish than to wonder that something which may happen every day has happened\non any one day? There is indeed a limit fixed for us, just where the remorseless law of Fate has\nfixed it; but none of us knows how near he is to this limit. Therefore, let us so order our minds as if\nwe had come to the very end. Let us postpone nothing. Let us balance life's account every day. The\ngreatest flaw in life is that it is always imperfect, and that a certain part of it is postponed. One who\ndaily puts the finishing touches to his life is never in want of time. And yet, from this want arise fear\nand a craving for the future which eats away the mind. There is nothing more wretched than worry\nover the outcome of future events; as to the amount or the nature of that which remains, our\ntroubled minds are set a-flutter with unaccountable fear.", "How, then, shall we avoid this vacillation? In one way only, ? if there be no reaching forward in our\nlife, if it is withdrawn into itself. For he only is anxious about the future, to whom the present is\nunprofitable. But when I have paid my soul its due, when a soundly-balanced mind knows that a day\ndiffers not a whit from eternity ? whatever days or problems the future may bring ? then the soul\nlooks forth from lofty heights and laughs heartily to itself when it thinks upon the ceaseless\nsuccession of the ages. For what disturbance can result from the changes and the instability of\nChance, if you are sure in the face of that which is unsure?", "Therefore, my dear Lucilius, begin at once to live, and count each separate day as a separate life.\nHe who has thus prepared himself, he whose daily life has been a rounded whole, is easy in his\nmind; but those who live for hope alone find that the immediate future always slips from their grasp\nand that greed steals along in its place, and the fear of death, a curse which lays a curse upon\neverything else.

You may nail me up and set my seat upon the piercing cross!\" Is it worth while to weigh down\nupon one's own wound, and hang impaled upon a gibbet, that one may but postpone something\nwhich is the balm of troubles, the end of punishment? Is it worth all this to possess the breath of life\nonly to give it up? What would you ask for Maecenas but the indulgence of Heaven? What does he\nmean by such womanish and indecent verse?

We must get rid of this craving for life, and learn that it makes no difference when your\nsuffering comes, because at some time you are bound to suffer.

I was taking pleasure in investigating\nthe immortality of souls, nay, in believing that doctrine. For I was lending a ready ear to the opinions\nof the great authors, who not only approve but promise this most pleasing condition. I was giving\nmyself over to such a noble hope; for I was already weary of myself, beginning already to despise\nthe fragments of my shattered existence, and feeling that I was destined to pass over into that\ninfinity of time and the heritage of eternity, when I was suddenly awakened by the receipt of your\nletter, and lost my lovely dream. But, if I can once dispose of you, I shall reseek and rescue it.", "There was a remark, at the beginning of your letter, that I had not explained the whole problem ?\nwherein I was endeavouring to prove one of the beliefs of our school, that the renown which falls to\none's lot after death is a good; for I had not solved the problem with which we are usually\nconfronted: \"No good can consist of things that are distinct and separate; yet renown consists of\nsuch things.\" What you are asking about, my dear Lucilius, belongs to another topic of the same\nsubject, and that is why I had postponed the arguments, not only on this one topic, but on other\ntopics which also covered the same ground. For, as you know, certain logical questions are mingled\nwith ethical ones. Accordingly, I handled the essential part of my subject which has to do with\nconduct ? as to whether it is foolish and useless to be concerned with what lies beyond our last day,\nor whether our goods die with us and there is nothing left of him who is no more, or whether any\nprofit can be attained or attempted beforehand out of that which, when it comes, we shall not be\ncapable of feeling.", "All these things have a view to conduct, and therefore they have been inserted under the proper\ntopic. But the remarks of dialecticians in opposition to this idea had to be sifted out, and were\naccordingly laid aside. Now that you demand an answer to them all, I shall examine all their\nstatements, and then refute them singly. Unless, however, I make a preliminary remark, it will be\nimpossible to understand my rebuttals. And what is that preliminary remark? Simply this: there are\ncertain continuous bodies, such as a man; there are certain composite bodies, ? as ships, houses,\nand everything which is the result of joining separate parts into one sum total: there are certain\nothers made up of things that are distinct, each member remaining separate ? like an army, a\npopulace, or a senate. For the persons who go to make up such bodies are united by virtue of law or\nfunction; but by their nature they are distinct and individual. Well, what further prefatory remarks do I\nstill wish to make? Simply this: we believe that nothing is a good, if it be composed of things that are\ndistinct. For a single good should be checked and controlled by a single soul; and the essential\nquality of each single good should be single. This can be proved of itself whenever you desire; in the\nmeanwhile, however, it had to be laid aside, because our own weapons are being hurled at us.", "Opponents speak thus: \"You say, do you, that no good can be made up of things that are distinct?\nYet this renown, of which you speak, is simply the favourable opinion of good men. For just as\nreputation does not consist of one person's remarks, and as ill repute does not consist of one\nperson's disapproval, so renown does not mean that we have merely pleased one good person. In\norder to constitute renown, the agreement of many distinguished and praiseworthy men is\nnecessary. But this results from the decision of a number ? in other words, of persons who are\ndistinct. Therefore, it is not a good. You say, again, that renown is the praise rendered to a good\nman by good men. Praise means speech: now speech is utterance with a particular meaning; and\nutterance, even from the lips of good men, is not a good in itself. For any act of a good man is not\nnecessarily a good; he shouts his applause and hisses his disapproval, but one does not call the\nshouting or the hissing good ? although his entire conduct may be admired and praised ? any more\nthan one would applaud a sneeze or a cough. Therefore, renown is not a good. Finally, tell us\nwhether the good belongs to him who praises, or to him who is praised: if you say that the good\nbelongs to him who is praised, you are on as foolish a quest as if you were to maintain that my\nneighbour's good health is my own. But to praise worthy men is an honourable action; thus the good\nis exclusively that of the man who does the praising, of the man who performs the action, and not of\nus, who are being praised. And yet this was the question under discussion.\"", "I shall now answer the separate objections hurriedly. The first question still is, whether any good can\nconsist of things that are distinct ? and there are votes cast on both sides. Again, does renown need\nmany votes? Renown can be satisfied with the decision of one good man: it is one good man who\ndecides that we are good. Then the retort is: \"What! Would you define reputation as the esteem of\none individual, and ill-repute as the rancorous chatter of one man? Glory, too, we take to be more\nwidespread, for it demands the agreement of many men.\" But the position of the \"many\" is different\nfrom that of \"the one.\" And why? Because, if the good man thinks well of me, it practically amounts\nto my being thought well of by all good men; for they will all think the same, if they know me. Their\njudgment is alike and identical; the effect of truth on it is equal. They cannot disagree, which means\nthat they would all hold the same view, being unable to hold different views. \"One man's opinion,\"\nyou say, \"is not enough to create glory or reputation.\" In the former case, one judgment is a\nuniversal judgment, because all, if they were asked, would hold one opinion; in the other case,\nhowever, men of dissimilar character give divergent judgments. You will find perplexing emotions ?\neverything doubtful, inconstant, untrustworthy. And can you suppose that all men are able to hold\none opinion? Even an individual does not hold to a single opinion. With the good man it is truth that\ncauses belief, and truth has but one function and one likeness; while among the second class of\nwhich I spoke, the ideas with which they agree are unsound. Moreover, those who are false are\nnever steadfast: they are irregular and discordant. \"But praise,\" says the objector, \"is nothing but an\nutterance, and an utterance is not a good.\" When they say that renown is praise bestowed on the\ngood by the good, what they refer to is not an utterance but a judgment. For a good man may\nremain silent; but if he decides that a certain person is worthy, of praise, that person is the object of\npraise. Besides, praise is one thing, and the giving of praise another; the latter demands utterance\nalso. Hence no one speaks of \"a funeral praise,\" but says \"praise-giving\" ? for its function depends\nupon speech. And when we say that a man is worthy of praise, we assure human kindness to him,\nnot in words, but in judgment. So the good opinion, even of one who in silence feels inward approval\nof a good man, is praise.", "Again, as I have said, praise is a matter of the mind rather than of the speech; for speech brings out\nthe praise that the mind has conceived, and publishes it forth to the attention of the many. To judge\na man worthy of praise, is to praise him. And when our tragic poet sings to us that it is wonderful \"to\nbe praised by a well-praised hero,\" he means, \"by one who is worthy of praise.\" Again, when an\nequally venerable bard says: \"Praise nurtureth the arts,\" he does not mean the giving of praise, for\nthat spoils the arts. Nothing has corrupted oratory and all other studies that depend on hearing so\nmuch as popular approval. Reputation necessarily demands words, but renown can be content with\nmen's judgments, and suffice without the spoken word. It is satisfied not only amid silent approval,\nbut even in the face of open protest. There is, in my opinion, this difference between renown and\nglory ? the latter depends upon the judgments of the many; but renown on the judgments of good\nmen. The retort comes: \"But whose good is this renown, this praise rendered to a good man by\ngood men? Is it of the one praised, or of the one who praises?\" Of both, I say. It is my own good, in\nthat I am praised, because I am naturally born to love all men, and I rejoice in having done good\ndeeds and congratulate myself on having found men who express their ideas of my virtues with\ngratitude; that they are grateful, is a good to the many, but it is a good to me also. For my spirit is so\nordered that I can regard the good of other men as my own ? in any case those of whose good I am\nmyself the cause. This good is also the good of those who render the praise, for it is applied by\nmeans of virtue; and every act of virtue is a good. My friends could not have found this blessing if I\nhad not been a man of the right stamp. It is therefore a good belonging to both sides ? this being\npraised when one deserves it ? just as truly as a good decision is the good of him who makes the\ndecision and also of him in whose favour the decision was given. Do you doubt that justice is a\nblessing to its possessor, as well as to the man to whom the just due was paid? To praise the\ndeserving is justice; therefore, the good belongs to both sides.", "This will be a sufficient answer to such dealers in subtleties. But it should not be our purpose to\ndiscuss things cleverly and to drag Philosophy down from her majesty to such petty quibbles. How\nmuch better it is to follow the open and direct road, rather than to map out for yourself a circuitous\nroute which you must retrace with infinite trouble! For such argumentation is nothing else than the\nsport of men who are skilfully juggling with each other. Tell me rather how closely in accord with\nnature it is to let one's mind reach out into the boundless universe! The human soul is a great and\nnoble thing; it permits of no limits except those which can be shared even by the gods. First of all, it\ndoes not consent to a lowly birthplace, like Ephesus or Alexandria, or any land that is even more\nthickly populated than these, and more richly spread with dwellings. The soul's homeland is the\nwhole space that encircles the, height and breadth of the firmament, the whole rounded dome within\nwhich lie land and sea, within which the upper air that sunders the human from the divine also unites\nthem, and where all the sentinel stars are taking their turn on duty. Again, the soul will not put up\nwith a narrow span of existence. \"All the years,\" says the soul, \"are mine; no epoch is closed to\ngreat minds; all Time is open for the progress of thought. When the day comes to separate the\nheavenly from its earthly blend, I shall leave the body here where I found it, and shall of my own\nvolition betake myself to the gods. I am not apart from them now, but am merely detained in a heavy\nand earthly prison.\" These delays of mortal existence are a prelude to the longer and better life. As\nthe mother's womb holds us for ten months, making us ready, not for the womb itself, but for the\nexistence into which we seem to be sent forth when at last we are fitted to draw breath and live in\nthe open; just so, throughout the years extending between infancy and old age, we are making\nourselves ready for another birth. A different beginning, a different condition, await us. We cannot\nyet, except at rare intervals, endure the light of heaven; therefore, look forward without fearing to\nthat appointed hour, ? the last hour of the body but not of the soul. Survey everything that lies about\nyou, as if it were luggage in a guest-chamber: you must travel on. Nature strips you as bare at your\ndeparture as at your entrance. You may take away no more than you brought in; what is more, you\nmust throw away the major portion of that which you brought with you into life: you will be stripped of", "the very skin which covers you ? that which has been your last protection; you will be stripped of the\nflesh, and lose the blood which is suffused and circulated through your body; you will be stripped of\nbones and sinews, the framework of these transitory and feeble parts.", "That day, which you fear as being the end of all things, is the birthday of your eternity. Lay aside\nyour burden ? why delay? ? just as if you had not previously left the body which was your\nhiding-place! You cling to your burden, you struggle; at your birth also great effort was necessary on\nyour mother's part to set you free. You weep and wail; and yet this very weeping happens at birth\nalso; but then it was to be excused ? for you came into the world wholly ignorant and inexperienced.\nWhen you left the warm and cherishing protection of your mother's womb, a freer air breathed into\nyour face; then you winced at the touch of a rough hand, and you looked in amaze at unfamiliar\nobjects, still delicate and ignorant of all things.", "But now it is no new thing for you to be sundered from that of which you have previously been a\npart; let go your already useless limbs with resignation and dispense with that body in which you\nhave dwelt for so long. It will be torn asunder, buried out of sight, and wasted away. Why be\ndowncast? This is what ordinarily happens: when we are born, the afterbirth always perishes. Why\nlove such a thing as if it were your own possession? It was merely your covering. The day will come\nwhich will tear you forth and lead you away from the company of the foul and noisome womb.\nWithdraw from it now too as much as you can, and withdraw from pleasure, except such as may be\nbound up with essential and important things; estrange yourself from it even now, and ponder on\nsomething nobler and loftier. Some day the secrets of nature shall be disclosed to you, the haze will\nbe shaken from your eyes, and the bright light will stream in upon you from all sides.", "Picture to yourself how great is the glow when all the stars mingle their fires; no shadows will disturb\nthe clear sky. The whole expanse of heaven will shine evenly; for day and night are interchanged\nonly in the lowest atmosphere. Then you will say that you have lived in darkness, after you have\nseen, in your perfect state, the perfect light ? that light which now you behold darkly with vision that\nis cramped to the last degree. And yet, far off as it is, you already look upon it in wonder; what do\nyou think the heavenly light will be when you have seen it in its proper sphere?", "From Maximus I learned self-government, and not to be led aside by anything; and cheerfulness in\nall circumstances, as well as in illness; and a just admixture in the moral character of sweetness and\ndignity, and to do what was set before me without complaining. I observed that everybody believed\nthat he thought as he spoke, and that in all that he did he never had any bad intention; and he never\nshowed amazement and surprise, and was never in a hurry, and never put off doing a thing, nor was\nperplexed nor dejected, nor did he ever laugh to disguise his vexation, nor, on the other hand, was\nhe ever passionate or suspicious. He was accustomed to do acts of beneficence, and was ready to\nforgive, and was free from all falsehood; and he presented the appearance of a man who could not\nbe diverted from right rather than of a man who had been improved. I observed, too, that no man\ncould ever think that he was despised by Maximus, or ever venture to think himself a better man.

Rather beware and shun those troubles which dog our\nsteps and reach out their hands against us. Accidents, though they may be serious, are few ? such\nas being shipwrecked or thrown from one's carriage; but it is from his fellow-man that a man's\neveryday danger comes. Equip yourself against that; watch that with an attentive eye. There is no\nevil more frequent, no evil more persistent, no evil more insinuating.

Not necessarily freedom from harm at their hands, but at least freedom from\ndeceit. In so far, however, as you are able, take refuge with philosophy: she will cherish you in her\nbosom, and in her sanctuary you shall be safe, or, at any rate, safer than before.

Farewell.", "I have run off to my villa at Nomentum, for what purpose, do you suppose? To escape the city? No;\nto shake off a fever which was surely working its way into my system. It had already got a grip upon\nme. My physician kept insisting that when the circulation was upset and irregular, disturbing the\nnatural poise, the disease was under way. I therefore ordered my carriage to be made ready at\nonce, and insisted on departing, in spite of my wife Paulina's efforts to stop me; for I remembered\nmy master Gallio's words, when he began to develop a fever in Achaia and took ship at once,\ninsisting that the disease was not of the body but of the place. That is what I remarked to my dear\nPaulina, who always urges me to take care of my health. I know that her very life-breath comes and\ngoes with my own, and I am beginning, in my solicitude for her, to be solicitous for myself. And\nalthough old age has made me braver to bear many things, I am gradually losing this boon that old\nage bestows. For it comes into my mind that in this old man there is a youth also, and youth needs\ntenderness. Therefore, since I cannot prevail upon her to love me any more heroically, she prevails\nupon me to cherish myself more carefully. For one must indulge genuine emotions; sometimes,\neven in spite of weighty reasons, the breath of life must be called back and kept at our very lips\neven at the price of great suffering, for the sake of those whom we hold dear; because the good\nman should not live as long as it pleases him, but as long as he ought.

It gives proof of a great heart to return to life for the sake of others; and noble\nmen have often done this. But this procedure also, I believe, indicates the highest type of kindness:\nthat although the greatest advantage of old age is the opportunity to be more negligent regarding\nself-preservation and to use life more adventurously, one should watch over one's old age with still\ngreater care if one knows that such action is pleasing, useful, or desirable in the eyes of a person\nwhom one holds dear. This is also a source of no mean joy and profit; for what is sweeter than to be\nso valued by one's wife that one becomes more valuable to oneself for this reason?

Many a sight that is held a terror in the night-time, is turned to ridicule by day.\n\"Shapes dread to look upon, of toil or death\": our Vergil has excellently said that these shapes are\ndread, not in reality, but only \"to look upon\" ? in other words, they seem terrible, but are not. And in\nthese visions what is there, I say, as fear-inspiring as rumour has proclaimed? Why, pray, my dear\nLucilius, should a man fear toil, or a mortal death? Countless cases occur to my mind of men who\nthink that what they themselves are unable to do is impossible, who maintain that we utter words\nwhich are too big for man's nature to carry out. But how much more highly do I think of these men!\nThey can do these things, but decline to do them. To whom that ever tried have these tasks proved\nfalse? To what man did they not seem easier in the doing? Our lack of confidence is not the result of\ndifficulty; the difficulty comes from our lack of confidence.", "Thou canst pass thy life in an equable flow of happiness, if thou canst go by the right way, and think\nand act in the right way. These two things are common both to the soul of God and to the soul of\nman, and to the soul of every rational being, not to be hindered by another; and to hold good to\nconsist in the disposition to justice and the practice of it, and in this to let thy desire find its\ntermination.", "If, however, you desire a pattern, take Socrates, a long-suffering old man, who was sea-tossed amid\nevery hardship and yet was unconquered both by poverty (which his troubles at home made more\nburdensome) and by toil, including the drudgery of military service. He was much tried at home,\nwhether we think of his wife, a woman of rough manners and shrewish tongue, or of the children\nwhose intractability showed them to be more like their mother than their father. And if you consider\nthe facts, he lived either in time of war, or under tyrants, or under a democracy, which is more cruel\nthan wars and tyrants. The war lasted for twenty-seven years; then the state became the victim of\nthe Thirty Tyrants, of whom many were his personal enemies. At the last came that climax of\ncondemnation under the gravest of charges: they accused him of disturbing the state religion and\ncorrupting the youth, for they declared that he had influenced the youth to defy the gods, to defy the\ncouncil, and to defy the state in general. Next came the prison, and the cup of poison. But all these\nmeasures changed the soul of Socrates so little that they did not even change his features. What\nwonderful and rare distinction! He maintained this attitude up to the very end, and no man ever saw\nSocrates too much elated or too much depressed. Amid all the disturbance of Fortune, he was\nundisturbed.", "Do you desire another case? Take that of the younger Marcus Cato, with whom Fortune dealt in a\nmore hostile and more persistent fashion. But he withstood her, on all occasions, and in his last\nmoments, at the point of death, showed that a brave man can live in spite of Fortune, can die in\nspite of her. His whole life was passed either in civil warfare, or under a political regime which was\nsoon to breed civil war. And you may say that he, just as much as Socrates, declared allegiance to\nliberty in the midst of slavery ? unless perchance you think that Pompey, Caesar, and Crassus were\nthe allies of liberty! No one ever saw Cato change, no matter how often the state changed: he kept\nhimself the same in all circumstances ? in the praetorship, in defeat, under accusation, in his\nprovince, on the platform, in the army, in death. Furthermore, when the republic was in a crisis of\nterror, when Caesar was on one side with ten embattled legions at his call, aided by so many foreign\nnations, and when Pompey was on the other, satisfied to stand alone against all comers, and when\nthe citizens were leaning towards either Caesar or Pompey, Cato alone established a definite party\nfor the Republic. If you would obtain a mental picture of that period, you may imagine on one side\nthe people and the whole proletariat eager for revolution ? on the other the senators and knights, the\nchosen and honoured men of the commonwealth; and there were left between them but these two ?\nthe Republic and Cato.", "Atreus' son, and Priam, and Achilles, wroth at both.", "Like Achilles, he scorns and disarms each faction. And this is the vote which he casts concerning\nthem both: \"If Caesar wins, I slay myself; if Pompey, I go into exile.\" What was there for a man to\nfear who, whether in defeat or in victory, had assigned to himself a doom which might have been\nassigned to him by his enemies in their utmost rage? So he died by his own decision.", "You see that man can endure toil: Cato, on foot, led an army through African deserts. You see that\nthirst can be endured: he marched over sun-baked hills, dragging the remains of a beaten army and\nwith no train of supplies, undergoing lack of water and wearing a heavy suit of armour; always the\nlast to drink of the few springs which they chanced to find. You see that honour, and dishonour too,\ncan be despised: for they report that on the very day when Cato was defeated at the elections, he\nplayed a game of ball. You see also that man can be free from fear of those above him in rank: for\nCato attacked Caesar and Pompey simultaneously, at a time when none dared fall foul of the one\nwithout endeavouring to oblige the other. You see that death can be scorned as well as exile: Cato\ninflicted exile upon himself and finally death, and war all the while.", "And so, if only we are willing to withdraw our necks from the yoke, we can keep as stout a heart\nagainst such terrors as these. But first and foremost, we must reject pleasures; they render us weak\nand womanish; they make great demands upon us, and, moreover, cause us to make great\ndemands upon Fortune. Second, we must spurn wealth: wealth is the diploma of slavery. Abandon\ngold and silver, and whatever else is a burden upon our richly-furnished homes; liberty cannot be\ngained for nothing. If you set a high value on liberty, you must set a low value on everything else.\nFarewell.", "I shall now tell you certain things to which you should pay attention in order to live more safely. Do\nyou however, ? such is my judgment, ? hearken to my precepts just as if I were counselling you to\nkeep safe your health in your country-place at Ardea.", "Reflect on the things which goad man into destroying man: you will find that they are hope, envy,\nhatred, fear, and contempt. Now, of all these, contempt is the least harmful, so much so that many\nhave skulked behind it as a sort of cure. When a man despises you, he works you injury, to be sure,\nbut he passes on; and no one persistently or of set purpose does hurt to a person whom he\ndespises. Even in battle, prostrate soldiers are neglected: men fight with those who stand their\nground. And you can avoid the envious hopes of the wicked so long as you have nothing which can\nstir the evil desires of others, and so long as you possess nothing remarkable. For people crave\neven little things, if these catch the attention or are of rare occurrence.", "You will escape envy if you do not force yourself upon the public view, if you do not boast your\npossessions, if you understand how to enjoy things privately. Hatred comes either from running foul\nof others: and this can be avoided by never provoking anyone; or else it is uncalled for: and\ncommon-sense will keep you safe from it. Yet it has been dangerous to many; some people have\nbeen hated without having had an enemy. As to not being feared, a moderate fortune and an easy\ndisposition will guarantee you that; men should know that you are the sort of person who can be\noffended without danger; and your reconciliation should be easy and sure. Moreover, it is as\ntroublesome to be feared at home as abroad; it is as bad to be feared by a slave as by a gentleman.\nFor every one has strength enough to do you some harm. Besides, he who is feared, fears also; no\none has been able to arouse terror and live in peace of mind.", "Contempt remains to be discussed. He who has made this quality an adjunct of his own personality,\nwho is despised because he wishes to be despised and not because he must be despised, has the\nmeasure of contempt under his control. Any inconveniences in this respect can be dispelled by\nhonourable occupations and by friendships with men who have influence with an influential person;\nwith these men it will profit you to engage but not to entangle yourself, lest the cure may cost you\nmore than the risk. Nothing, however, will help you so much as keeping still ? talking very little with\nothers, and as much as may be with yourself. For there is a sort of charm about conversation,\nsomething very subtle and coaxing, which, like intoxication or love, draws secrets from us. No man\nwill keep to himself what he hears. No one will tell another only as much as he has heard. And he\nwho tells tales will tell names, too. Everyone has someone to whom he entrusts exactly what has\nbeen entrusted to him. Though he checks his own garrulity, and is content with one hearer, he will\nbring about him a nation, if that which was a secret shortly before becomes common talk.", "If this is neither my own badness, nor an effect of my own badness, and the common weal is not\ninjured, why am I troubled about it? And what is the harm to the common weal?", "The most important contribution to peace of mind is never to do wrong. Those who lack self-control\nlead disturbed and tumultuous lives; their crimes are balanced by their fears, and they are never at\nease. For they tremble after the deed, and they are embarrassed; their consciences do not allow\nthem to busy themselves with other matters, and continually compel them to give an answer.\nWhoever expects punishment, receives it, but whoever deserves it, expects it. Where there is an evil\nconscience something may bring safety, but nothing can bring ease; for a man imagines that, even if\nhe is not under arrest, he may soon be arrested. His sleep is troubled; when he speaks of another\nman's crime, he reflects upon his own, which seems to him not sufficiently blotted out, not\nsufficiently hidden from view. A wrongdoer sometimes has the luck to escape notice but never the\nassurance thereof. Farewell.", "My tardiness in answering your letter was not due to press of business. Do not listen to that sort of\nexcuse; I am at liberty, and so is anyone else who wishes to be at liberty. No man is at the mercy of\naffairs. He gets entangled in them of his own accord, and then flatters himself that being busy is a\nproof of happiness. Very well; you no doubt want to know why I did not answer the letter sooner?\nThe matter about which you consulted me was being gathered into the fabric of my volume. For you\nknow that I am planning to cover the whole of moral philosophy and to settle all the problems which\nconcern it. Therefore I hesitated whether to make you wait until the proper time came for this\nsubject, or to pronounce judgment out of the logical order; but it seemed more kindly not to keep\nwaiting one who comes from such a distance. So I propose both to pick this out of the proper\nsequence of correlated matter, and also to send you, without waiting to be asked, whatever has to\ndo with questions of the same sort.", "Do you ask what these are? Questions regarding which knowledge pleases rather than profits; for\ninstance, your question whether the good is corporeal. Now the good is active: for it is beneficial;\nand what is active is corporeal. The good stimulates the mind and, in a way, moulds and embraces\nthat which is essential to the body. The goods of the body are bodily; so therefore must be the\ngoods of the soul. For the soul, too, is corporeal. Ergo, man's good must be corporeal, since man\nhimself is corporeal. I am sadly astray if the elements which support man and preserve or restore his\nhealth, are not bodily; therefore, his good is a body. You will have no doubt, I am sure, that emotions\nare bodily things (if I may be allowed to wedge in another subject not under immediate discussion),\nlike wrath, love, sternness; unless you doubt whether they change our features, knot our foreheads,\nrelax the countenance, spread blushes, or drive away the blood? What, then? Do you think that\nsuch evident marks of the body are stamped upon us by anything else than body? And if emotions\nare corporeal, so are the diseases of the spirit ? such as greed, cruelty, and all the faults which\nharden in our souls, to such an extent that they get into an incurable state. Therefore evil is also,\nand all its branches ? spite, hatred, pride; and so also are goods, first because they are opposite\npoles of the bad, and second because they will manifest to you the same symptoms. Do you not see\nhow a spirit of bravery makes the eye flash? How prudence tends towards concentration? How\nreverence produces moderation and tranquillity? How joy produces calm? How sternness begets\nstiffness? How gentleness produces relaxation? These qualities are therefore bodily; for they\nchange the tones and the shapes of substances, exercising their own power in their own kingdoms.", "Now all the virtues which I have mentioned are goods, and so are their results. Have you any doubt\nthat whatever can touch is corporeal?", "Nothing but body can touch or be touched,\nas Lucretius says. Moreover, such changes as I have mentioned could not affect the body without\ntouching it. Therefore, they are bodily. Furthermore, any object that has power to move, force,\nrestrain, or control, is corporeal. Come now! Does not fear hold us back? Does not boldness drive\nus ahead? Bravery spur us on, and give us momentum? Restraint rein us in and call us back? Joy\nraise our spirits? Sadness cast us down? In short, any act on our part is performed at the bidding of\nwickedness or virtue. Only a body can control or forcefully affect another body. The good of the\nbody is corporeal; a man's good is related to his bodily good; therefore, it is bodily.", "Now that I have humoured your wishes, I shall anticipate your remark, when you say: \"What a game\nof pawns!\" We dull our fine edge by such superfluous pursuits; these things make men clever, but\nnot good.

None of these things is unusual or unexpected. It\nis as nonsensical to be put out by such events as to complain of being spattered in the street or at\ngetting befouled in the mud. The programme of life is the same as that of a bathing establishment, a\ncrowd, or a journey: sometimes things will be thrown at you, and sometimes they will strike you by\naccident. Life is not a dainty business. You have started on a long journey; you are bound to slip,\ncollide, fall, become weary, and cry out: \"O for Death!\" ? or in other words, tell lies.

Even as he paced up and down, I would\nchallenge him to various discussions; for he not only kept himself accessible to his pupils, but met\nthem half-way. His words were: \"The same purpose should possess both master and scholar ? an\nambition in the one case to promote, and in the other to progress.\" He who studies with a\nphilosopher should take away with him some one good thing every day: he should daily return home\na sounder man, or in the way to become sounder. And he will thus return; for it is one of the\nfunctions of philosophy to help not only those who study her, but those also who associate with her.\nHe that walks in the sun, though he walk not for that purpose, must needs become sunburned. He\nwho frequents the perfumer's shop and lingers even for a short time, will carry with him the scent of\nthe place. And he who follows a philosopher is bound to derive some benefit therefrom, which will\nhelp him even though he be remiss. Mark what I say: \"remiss,\" not \"recalcitrant.\"", "\"What then?\" you say, \"do we not know certain men who have sat for many years at the feet of a\nphilosopher and yet have not acquired the slightest tinge of wisdom?\" Of course I know such men.\nThere are indeed persevering gentlemen who stick at it; I do not call them pupils of the wise, but\nmerely \"squatters.\" Certain of them come to hear and not to learn, just as we are attracted to the\ntheatre to satisfy the pleasures of the ear, whether by a speech, or by a song, or by a play. This\nclass, as you will see, constitutes a large part of the listeners, who regard the philosopher's\nlecture-room merely as a sort of lounging-place for their leisure. They do not set about to lay aside\nany faults there, or to receive a rule of life, by which they may test their characters; they merely wish\nto enjoy to the full the delights of the ear. And yet some arrive even with notebooks, not to take\ndown the matter, but only the words, that they may presently repeat them to others with as little\nprofit to these as they themselves received when they heard them. A certain number are stirred by\nhigh-sounding phrases, and adapt themselves to the emotions of the speaker with lively change of\nface and mind ? just like the emasculated Phrygian priests who are wont to be roused by the sound\nof the flute and go mad to order. But the true hearer is ravished and stirred by the beauty of the\nsubject matter, not by the jingle of empty words. When a bold word has been uttered in defiance of\ndeath, or a saucy fling in defiance of Fortune, we take delight in acting straightway upon that which\nwe have heard. Men are impressed by such words, and become what they are bidden to be, should\nbut the impression abide in the mind, and should the populace, who discourage honourable things,\nnot immediately lie in wait to rob them of this noble impulse; only a few can carry home the mental\nattitude with which they were inspired. It is easy to rouse a listener so that he will crave\nrighteousness; for Nature has laid the foundations and planted the seeds of virtue in us all. And we\nare all born to these general privileges; hence, when the stimulus is added, the good spirit is stirred\nas if it were freed from bonds. Have you not noticed how the theatre re-echoes whenever any words\nare spoken whose truth we appreciate generally and confirm unanimously?", "When thou art calling out on the Rostra, hast thou forgotten, man, what these things are?- Yes; but\nthey are objects of great concern to these people- wilt thou too then be made a fool for these\nthings?- I was once a fortunate man, but I lost it, I know not how.- But fortunate means that a man\nhas assigned to himself a good fortune: and a good fortune is good disposition of the soul, good\nemotions, good actions.", "At such verses as these, your meanest miser claps applause and rejoices to hear his own sins\nreviled. How much more do you think this holds true, when such things are uttered by a philosopher,\nwhen he introduces verses among his wholesome precepts, that he may thus make those verses\nsink more effectively into the mind of the neophyte! Cleanthes used to say: \"As our breath produces\na louder sound when it passes through the long and narrow opening of the trumpet and escapes by\na hole which widens at the end, even so the fettering rules of poetry clarify our meaning.\" The very\nsame words are more carelessly received and make less impression upon us, when they are\nspoken in prose; but when metre is added and when regular prosody has compressed a noble idea,\nthen the selfsame thought comes, as it were, hurtling with a fuller fling. We talk much about\ndespising money, and we give advice on this subject in the lengthiest of speeches, that mankind\nmay believe true riches to exist in the mind and not in one's bank account, and that the man who\nadapts himself to his slender means and makes himself wealthy on a little sum, is the truly rich man;\nbut our minds are struck more effectively when a verse like this is repeated:", "When we hear such words as these, we are led towards a confession of the truth.", "Even men in whose opinion nothing is enough, wonder and applaud when they hear such words,\nand swear eternal hatred against money. When you see them thus disposed, strike home, keep at\nthem, and charge them with this duty, dropping all double meanings, syllogisms, hair-splitting, and\nthe other side-shows of ineffective smartness. Preach against greed, preach against high living; and\nwhen you notice that you have made progress and impressed the minds of your hearers, lay on still\nharder. You cannot imagine how much progress can be brought about by an address of that nature,\nwhen you are bent on curing your hearers and are absolutely devoted to their best interests. For\nwhen the mind is young, it may most easily be won over to desire what is honourable and upright;\ntruth, if she can obtain a suitable pleader, will lay strong hands upon those who can still be taught,\nthose who have been but superficially spoiled.", "At any rate, when I used to hear Attalus denouncing sin, error, and the evils of life, I often felt sorry\nfor mankind and regarded Attalus as a noble and majestic being, ? above our mortal heights. He\ncalled himself a king, but I thought him more than a king, because he was entitled to pass judgment\non kings. And in truth, when he began to uphold poverty, and to show what a useless and\ndangerous burden was everything that passed the measure of our need, I often desired to leave his\nlecture-room a poor man. Whenever he castigated our pleasure-seeking lives, and extolled personal\npurity, moderation in diet, and a mind free from unnecessary, not to speak of unlawful, pleasures,\nthe desire came upon me to limit my food and drink. And that is why some of these habits have\nstayed with me, Lucilius. For I had planned my whole life with great resolves. And later, when I\nreturned to the duties of a citizen, I did indeed keep a few of these good resolutions. That is why I\nhave forsaken oysters and mushrooms for ever: since they are not really food, but are relishes to\nbully the sated stomach into further eating, as is the fancy of gourmands and those who stuff\nthemselves beyond their powers of digestion: down with it quickly, and up with it quickly! That is why\nI have also throughout my life avoided perfumes; because the best scent for the person is no scent\nat all. That is why my stomach is unacquainted with wine. That is why throughout my life I have\nshunned the bath, and have believed that to emaciate the body and sweat it into thinness is at once\nunprofitable and effeminate. Other resolutions have been broken, but after all in such a way that, in\ncases where I ceased to practice abstinence, I have observed a limit which is indeed next door to\nabstinence; perhaps it is even a little more difficult, because it is easier for the will to cut off certain\nthings utterly than to use them with restraint.", "Inasmuch as I have begun to explain to you how much greater was my impulse to approach\nphilosophy in my youth than to continue it in my old age, I shall not be ashamed to tell you what\nardent zeal Pythagoras inspired in me. Sotion used to tell me why Pythagoras abstained from\nanimal food, and why, in later times, Sextius did also. In each case, the reason was different, but it\nwas in each case a noble reason. Sextius believed that man had enough sustenance without\nresorting to blood, and that a habit of cruelty is formed whenever butchery is practised for pleasure.\nMoreover, he thought we should curtail the sources of our luxury; he argued that a varied diet was\ncontrary to the laws of health, and was unsuited to our constitutions. Pythagoras, on the other hand,\nheld that all beings were inter-related, and that there was a system of exchange between souls\nwhich transmigrated from one bodily shape into another. If one may believe him, no soul perishes or\nceases from its functions at all, except for a tiny interval ? when it is being poured from one body\ninto another. We may question at what time and after what seasons of change the soul returns to\nman, when it has wandered through many a dwelling-place; but meantime, he made men fearful of\nguilt and parricide, since they might be, without knowing it, attacking the soul of a parent and injuring\nit with knife or with teeth ? if, as is possible, the related spirit be dwelling temporarily in this bit of\nflesh! When Sotion had set forth this doctrine, supplementing it with his own proofs, he would say:\n\"You do not believe that souls are assigned, first to one body and then to another, and that our\nso-called death is merely a change of abode? You do not believe that in cattle, or in wild beasts, or\nin creatures of the deep, the soul of him who was once a man may linger? You do not believe that\nnothing on this earth is annihilated, but only changes its haunts? And that animals also have cycles\nof progress and, so to speak, an orbit for their souls, no less than the heavenly bodies, which\nrevolve in fixed circuits? Great men have put faith in this idea; therefore, while holding to your own\nview, keep the whole question in abeyance in your mind. If the theory is true, it is a mark of purity to\nrefrain from eating flesh; if it be false, it is economy. And what harm does it do to you to give such\ncredence? I am merely depriving you of food which sustains lions and vultures.\"", "I was imbued with this teaching, and began to abstain from animal food; at the end of a year the\nhabit was as pleasant as it was easy. I was beginning to feel that my mind was more active; though I\nwould not to-day positively state whether it really was or not. Do you ask how I came to abandon the\npractice? It was this way: The days of my youth coincided with the early part of the reign of Tiberius\nCaesar. Some foreign rites were at that time being inaugurated, and abstinence from certain kinds\nof animal food was set down as a proof of interest in the strange cult. So at the request of my father,\nwho did not fear prosecution, but who detested philosophy, I returned to my previous habits; and it\nwas no very hard matter to induce me to dine more comfortably.", "Attalus used to recommend a pillow which did not give in to the body; and now, old as I am, I use\none so hard that it leaves no trace after pressure. I have mentioned all this in order to show you how\nzealous neophytes are with regard to their first impulses towards the highest ideals, provided that\nsome one does his part in exhorting them and in kindling their ardour. There are indeed mistakes\nmade, through the fault of our advisers, who teach us how to debate and not how to live; there are\nalso mistakes made by the pupils, who come to their teachers to develop, not their souls, but their\nwits. Thus the study of wisdom has become the study of words.", "The substance of the universe is obedient and compliant; and the reason which governs it has in\nitself no cause for doing evil, for it has no malice, nor does it do evil to anything, nor is anything\nharmed by it. But all things are made and perfected according to this reason.", "Now it makes a great deal of difference what you have in mind when you approach a given subject.\nIf a man is to be a scholar, and is examining the works of Vergil, he does not interpret the noble\npassage", "in the following sense: \"We must wake up; unless we hasten, we shall be left behind. Time rolls\nswiftly ahead, and rolls us with it. We are hurried along ignorant of our destiny; we arrange all our\nplans for the future, and on the edge of a precipice are at our ease.\" Instead of this, he brings to our\nattention how often Vergil, in speaking of the rapidity of time, uses the word \"flies\" (fugit).", "Fly first; disease and bitter eld succeed,\nAnd toil, till harsh death rudely snatches all.", "He who considers these lines in the spirit of a philosopher comments on the words in their proper\nsense: \"Vergil never says, 'Time goes,' but 'Time flies,' because the latter is the quickest kind of\nmovement, and in every case our best days are the first to be snatched away; why, then, do we\nhesitate to bestir ourselves so that we may be able to keep pace with this swiftest of all swift\nthings?\" The good flies past and the bad takes its place. Just as the purest wine flows from the top\nof the jar and the thickest dregs settle at the bottom; so in our human life, that which is best comes\nfirst. Shall we allow other men to quaff the best, and keep the dregs for ourselves? Let this phrase\ncleave to your soul; you should be satisfied thereby as if it were uttered by an oracle:", "Why \"choicest day\"? Because what's to come is unsure. Why \"choicest day\"? Because in our youth\nwe are able to learn; we can bend to nobler purposes minds that are ready and still pliable; because\nthis is the time for work, the time for keeping our minds busied in study and in exercising our bodies\nwith useful effort; for that which remains is more sluggish and lacking in spirit ? nearer the end.", "Let us therefore strive with all courage, omitting attractions by the way; let us struggle with a single\npurpose, lest, when we are left behind, we comprehend too late the speed of quick-flying time,\nwhose course we cannot stay. Let every day, as soon as it comes, be welcome as being the\nchoicest, and let it be made our own possession. We must catch that which flees. Now he who\nscans with a scholar's eye the lines I have just quoted, does not reflect that our first days are the\nbest because disease is approaching and old age weighs upon us and hangs over our heads while\nwe are still thinking about our youth. He thinks rather of Vergil's usual collocation of disease and eld;\nand indeed rightly. For old age is a disease which we cannot cure. \"Besides,\" he says to himself,\n\"think of the epithet that accompanies eld; Vergil calls it bitter,\" ?", "Disease and bitter eld succeed.\nAnd elsewhere Vergil says:", "There is no reason why you should marvel that each man can collect from the same source suitable\nmatter for his own studies; for in the same meadow the cow grazes, the dog hunts the hare, and the\nstork the lizard. When Cicero's book On the State is opened by a philologist, a scholar, or a follower\nof philosophy, each man pursues his investigation in his own way. The philosopher wonders that so\nmuch could have been said therein against justice. The philologist takes up the same book and\ncomments on the text as follows: There were two Roman kings ? one without a father and one\nwithout a mother. For we cannot settle who was Servius's mother, and Ancus, the grandson of\nNuma, has no father on record. The philologist also notes that the officer whom we call dictator, and\nabout whom we read in our histories under that title, was named in old times the magister populi;\nsuch is the name existing to-day in the augural records, proved by the fact that he whom the dictator\nchose as second in command was called magister equitum. He will remark, too, that Romulus met\nhis end during an eclipse; that there was an appeal to the people even from the kings (this is so\nstated in the pontiffs' register and is the opinion of others, including Fenestella). When the scholar\nunrolls this same volume, he puts down in his notebook the forms of words, noting that reapse,\nequivalent to re ipsa, is used by Cicero, and sepse just as frequently, which means se ipse. Then he\nturns his attention to changes in current usage. Cicero, for example, says: \"Inasmuch as we are\nsummoned back from the very calx by his interruption.\" Now the line in the circus which we call the\ncreta was called the calx by men of old time. Again, he puts together some verses by Ennius,\nespecially those which referred to Africanus:", "Let it make no difference to thee whether thou art cold or warm, if thou art doing thy duty; and\nwhether thou art drowsy or satisfied with sleep; and whether ill-spoken of or praised; and whether\ndying or doing something else. For it is one of the acts of life, this act by which we die: it is sufficient\nthen in this act also to do well what we have in hand.", "From this passage the scholar declares that he infers the word opem to have meant formerly not\nmerely assistance, but efforts. For Ennius must mean that neither friend nor foe could pay Scipio a\nreward worthy of his efforts. Next, he congratulates himself on finding the source of Vergil's words:", "remarking that Ennius stole the idea from Homer, and Vergil from Ennius. For there is a couplet by\nEnnius, preserved in this same book of Cicero's, On the State:", "If it be right for a mortal to scale the regions of Heaven,", "Then the huge gate of the sky opens in glory to me.", "But that I, too, while engaged upon another task, may not slip into the department of the philologist\nor the scholar, my advice is this ? that all study of philosophy and all reading should be applied to\nthe idea of living the happy life, that we should not hunt out archaic or far-fetched words and\neccentric metaphors and figures of speech, but that we should seek precepts which will help us,\nutterances of courage and spirit which may at once be turned into facts. We should so learn them\nthat words may become deeds. And I hold that no man has treated mankind worse than he who has\nstudied philosophy as if it were some marketable trade, who lives in a different manner from that\nwhich he advises. For those who are liable to every fault which they castigate advertise themselves\nas patterns of useless training. A teacher like that can help me no more than a sea-sick pilot can be\nefficient in a storm. He must hold the tiller when the waves are tossing him; he must wrestle, as it\nwere, with the sea; he must furl his sails when the storm rages; what good is a frightened and\nvomiting steersman to me? And how much greater, think you, is the storm of life than that which\ntosses any ship! One must steer, not talk.", "All the words that these men utter and juggle before a listening crowd, belong to others. They have\nbeen spoken by Plato, spoken by Zeno, spoken by Chrysippus or by Posidonius, and by a whole\nhost of Stoics as numerous as excellent. I shall show you how men can prove their words to be their\nown: it is by doing what they have been talking about. Since therefore I have given you the message\nI wished to pass on to you, I shall now satisfy your craving and shall reserve for a new letter a\ncomplete answer to your summons; so that you may not approach in a condition of weariness a\nsubject which is thorny and which should be followed with an attentive and painstaking ear.\nFarewell.", "You expressed a wish to know whether a wise man can help a wise man. For we say that the wise\nman is completely endowed with every good, and has attained perfection; accordingly, the question\narises how it is possible for anyone to help a person who possesses the Supreme Good.", "Good men are mutually helpful; for each gives practice to the other's virtues and thus maintains\nwisdom at its proper level. Each needs someone with whom he may make comparisons and\ninvestigations. Skilled wrestlers are kept up to the mark by practice; a musician is stirred to action by\none of equal proficiency. The wise man also needs to have his virtues kept in action; and as he\nprompts himself to do things, so is he prompted by another wise man. How can a wise man help\nanother wise man? He can quicken his impulses, and point out to him opportunities for honourable\naction. Besides, he can develop some of his own ideas; he can impart what he has discovered. For\neven in the case of the wise man something will always remain to discover, something towards\nwhich his mind may make new ventures.", "Look within. Let neither the peculiar quality of anything nor its value escape thee.", "Evil men harm evil men; each debases the other by rousing his wrath, by approving his\nchurlishness, and praising his pleasures; bad men are at their worst stage when their faults are most\nthoroughly intermingled, and their wickedness has been, so to speak, pooled in partnership.\nConversely, therefore, a good man will help another good man. \"How?\" you ask. Because he will\nbring joy to the other, he will strengthen his faith, and from the contemplation of their mutual\ntranquillity the delight of both will be increased. Moreover, they will communicate to each other a\nknowledge of certain facts; for the wise man is not all-knowing. And even if he were all-knowing,\nsomeone might be able to devise and point out short cuts, by which the whole matter is more readily\ndisseminated. The wise will help the wise, not, mark you, because of his own strength merely, but\nbecause of the strength of the man whom he assists. The latter, it is true, can by himself develop his\nown parts; nevertheless, even one who is running well is helped by one who cheers him on.", "\"But the wise man does not really help the wise; he helps himself. Let me tell you this: strip the one\nof his special powers, and the other will accomplish nothing.\" You might as well, on that basis, say\nthat sweetness is not in the honey: for it is the person himself who is to eat it, that is so equipped, as\nto tongue and palate, for tasting this kind of food that the special flavour appeals to him, and\nanything else displeases. For there are certain men so affected by disease that they regard honey\nas bitter. Both men should be in good health, that the one may be helpful and the other a proper\nsubject for help. Again they say: \"When the highest degree of heat has been attained, it is\nsuperfluous to apply more heat; and when the Supreme Good has been attained, it is superfluous to\nhave a helper. Does a completely stocked farmer ask for further supplies from his neighbours? Does\na soldier who is sufficiently armed for going well-equipped into action need any more weapons?\nVery well, neither does the wise man; for he is sufficiently equipped and sufficiently armed for life.\"\nMy answer to this is, that when one is heated to the highest degree, one must have continued heat\nto maintain the highest temperature. And if it be objected that heat is self-maintaining, I say that\nthere are great distinctions among the things that you are comparing; for heat is a single thing, but\nhelpfulness is of many kinds. Again, heat is not helped by the addition of further heat, in order to be\nhot; but the wise man cannot maintain his mental standard without intercourse with friends of his\nown kind ? with whom he may share his goodness. Moreover, there is a sort of mutual friendship\namong all the virtues. Thus, he who loves the virtues of certain among his peers, and in turn exhibits\nhis own to be loved, is helpful. Like things give pleasure, especially when they are honourable and\nwhen men know that there is mutual approval. And besides, none but a wise man can prompt\nanother wise man's soul in an intelligent way, just as man can be prompted in a rational way by man\nonly. As, therefore, reason is necessary for the prompting of reason, so, in order to prompt perfect\nreason, there is need of perfect reason.", "Some say that we are helped even by those who bestow on us the so-called \"indifferent\" benefits,\nsuch as money, influence, security, and all the other valued or essential aids to living. If we argue in\nthis way, the veriest fool will be said to help a wise man. Helping, however, really means prompting\nthe soul in accordance with Nature, both by the prompter's excellence and by the excellence of him\nwho is thus prompted. And this cannot take place without advantage to the helper also. For in\ntraining the excellence of another, a man must necessarily train his own. But, to omit from\ndiscussion supreme goods or the things which produce them, wise men can none the less be\nmutually helpful. For the mere discovery of a sage by a sage is in itself a desirable event; since\neverything good is naturally dear to the good man, and for this reason one feels congenial with a\ngood man as one feels congenial with oneself.", "It is necessary for me to pass from this topic to another, in order to prove my point. For the question\nis asked, whether the wise man will weigh his opinions, or whether he will apply to others for advice.\nNow he is compelled to do this when he approaches state and home duties ? everything, so to\nspeak, that is mortal. He needs outside advice on such matters, as does the physician, the pilot, the\nattorney, or the pleader of cases. Hence, the wise will sometimes help the wise; for they will\npersuade each other. But in these matters of great import also, ? aye, of divine import, as I have\ntermed them, ? the wise man can also be useful by discussing honourable things in common, and\nby contributing his thoughts and ideas. Moreover, it is in accordance with Nature to show affection\nfor our friends, and to rejoice in their advancement as if it were absolutely our own. For if we have\nnot done this, even virtue, which grows strong only through exercising our perceptions, will not abide\nwith us. Now virtue advises us to arrange the present well, to take thought regarding the future, to\ndeliberate and apply our minds; and one who takes a friend into council with him, can more easily\napply his mind and think out his problem.", "Therefore he will seek either the perfect wise man or one who has progressed to a point bordering\non perfection. The perfect wise man, moreover, will help us if he aids our counsels with ordinary\ngood sense. They say that men see farther in the affairs of others than in their own. A defect of\ncharacter causes this in those who are blinded by self-love, and whose fear in the hour of peril takes\naway their clear view of that which is useful; it is when a man is more at ease and freed from fear\nthat he will begin to be wise. Nevertheless, there are certain matters where even wise men see the\nfacts more clearly in the case of others than in their own. Moreover, the wise man will, in company\nwith his fellow sage, confirm the truth of that most sweet and honourable proverb ? \"always desiring\nand always refusing the same things\": it will be a noble result when they draw the load \"with equal\nyoke.\"", "I have thus answered your demand, although it came under the head of subjects which I include in\nmy volumes On Moral Philosophy. Reflect, as I am often wont to tell you, that there is nothing in\nsuch topics for us except mental gymnastics. For I return again and again to the thought: \"What\ngood does this do me? Make me more brave now, more just, more restrained! I have not yet the\nopportunity to make use of my training; for I still need the physician. Why do you ask of me a\nuseless knowledge? You have promised great things; test me, watch me! You assured me that I\nshould be unterrified though swords were flashing round me, though the point of the blade were\ngrazing my throat; you assured me that I should be at ease though fires were blazing round me, or\nthough a sudden whirlwind should snatch up my ship and carry it over all the sea. Now make good\nfor me such a course of treatment that I may despise pleasure and glory. Thereafter you shall teach\nme to work out complicated problems, to settle doubtful points, to see through that which is not\nclear; teach me now what it is necessary for me to know!\" Farewell.", "From my villa at Nomentum I send you greeting and bid you keep a sound spirit within you ? in other\nwords, gain the blessing of all the gods, for he is assured of their grace and favour who has become\na blessing to himself. Lay aside for the present the belief of certain persons ? that a god is assigned\nto each one of us as a sort of attendant ? not a god of regular rank, but one of a lower grade ? one\nof those whom Ovid calls \"plebeian gods.\" Yet, while laying aside this belief, I would have you\nremember that our ancestors, who followed such a creed, have become Stoics; for they have\nassigned a Genius or a Juno to every individual. Later on we shall investigate whether the gods\nhave enough time on their hands to care for the concerns of private individuals; in the meantime,\nyou must know that whether we are allotted to special guardians, or whether we are neglected and\nconsigned to Fortune, you can curse a man with no heavier curse than to pray that he may be at\nenmity with himself.", "There is no reason, however, why you should ask the gods to be hostile to anyone whom you\nregard as deserving of punishment; they are hostile to such a person, I maintain, even though he\nseems to be advanced by their favour. Apply careful investigation, considering how our affairs\nactually stand, and not what men say of them; you will then understand that evils are more likely to\nhelp us than to harm us. For how often has so-called affliction been the source and the beginning of\nhappiness! How often have privileges which we welcomed with deep thanksgiving built steps for\nthemselves to the top of a precipice, still uplifting men who were already distinguished ? just as if\nthey had previously stood in a position whence they could fall in safety! But this very fall has in it\nnothing evil, if you consider the end, after which nature lays no man lower. The universal limit is\nnear; yes, there is near us the point where the prosperous man is upset, and the point where the\nunfortunate is set free. It is we ourselves that extend both these limits, lengthening them by our\nhopes and by our fears.", "If, however, you are wise, measure all things according to the state of man; restrict at the same time\nboth your joys and your fears. Moreover, it is worth while not to rejoice at anything for long, so that\nyou may not fear anything for long. But why do I confine the scope of this evil? There is no reason\nwhy you should suppose that anything is to be feared. All these things which stir us and keep us\na-flutter, are empty things. None of us has sifted out the truth; we have passed fear on to one\nanother; none has dared to approach the object which caused his dread, and to understand the\nnature of his fear ? aye, the good behind it. That is why falsehood and vanity still gain credit ?\nbecause they are not refuted. Let us account it worth while to look closely at the matter; then it will\nbe clear how fleeting, how unsure, and how harmless are the things which we fear. The disturbance\nin our spirits is similar to that which Lucretius detected:", "All existing things soon change, and they will either be reduced to vapour, if indeed all substance is\none, or they will be dispersed.", "What, then? Are we not more foolish than any child, we who \"in the light of day feel fear\"? But you\nwere wrong, Lucretius; we are not afraid in the daylight; we have turned everything into a state of\ndarkness. We see neither what injures nor what profits us; all our lives through we blunder along,\nneither stopping nor treading more carefully on this account. But you see what madness it is to rush\nahead in the dark. Indeed, we are bent on getting ourselves called back from a greater distance;\nand though we do not know our goal, yet we hasten with wild speed in the direction whither we are\nstraining.", "The light, however, may begin to shine, provided we are willing. But such a result can come about\nonly in one way ? if we acquire by knowledge this familiarity with things divine and human, if we not\nonly flood ourselves but steep ourselves therein, if a man reviews the same principles even though\nhe understands them and applies them again and again to himself, if he has investigated what is\ngood, what is evil, and what has falsely been so entitled; and, finally, if he has investigated honour\nand baseness, and Providence. The range of the human intelligence is not confined within these\nlimits; it may also explore outside the universe ? its destination and its source, and the ruin towards\nwhich all nature hastens so rapidly. We have withdrawn the soul from this divine contemplation and\ndragged it into mean and lowly tasks, so that it might be a slave to greed, so that it might forsake the\nuniverse and its confines, and, under the command of masters who try all possible schemes, pry\nbeneath the earth and seek what evil it can dig up therefrom ? discontented with that which was\nfreely offered to it.", "Now God, who is the Father of us all, has placed ready to our hands those things which he intended\nfor our own good; he did not wait for any search on our part, and he gave them to us voluntarily. But\nthat which would be injurious, he buried deep in the earth. We can complain of nothing but\nourselves; for we have brought to light the materials for our destruction, against the will of Nature,\nwho hid them from us. We have bound over our souls to pleasure, whose service is the source of all\nevil; we have surrendered ourselves to self-seeking and reputation, and to other aims which are\nequally idle and useless.", "What, then, do I now encourage you to do? Nothing new ? we are not trying to find cures for new\nevils ? but this first of all: namely, to see clearly for yourself what is necessary and what is\nsuperfluous. What is necessary will meet you everywhere; what is superfluous has always to be\nhunted-out ? and with great endeavour. But there is no reason why you should flatter yourself\nover-much if you despise gilded couches and jewelled furniture. For what virtue lies in despising\nuseless things? The time to admire your own conduct is when you have come to despise the\nnecessities. You are doing no great thing if you can live without royal pomp, if you feel no craving for\nboars which weigh a thousand pounds, or for flamingo tongues, or for the other absurdities of a\nluxury that already wearies of game cooked whole, and chooses different bits from separate\nanimals; I shall admire you only when you have learned to scorn even the common sort of bread,\nwhen you have made yourself believe that grass grows for the needs of men as well as of cattle,\nwhen you have found out that food from the treetop can fill the belly ? into which we cram things of\nvalue as if it could keep what it has received. We should satisfy our stomachs without being\nover-nice. How does it matter what the stomach receives, since it must lose whatever it has\nreceived? You enjoy the carefully arranged dainties which are caught on land and sea; some are\nmore pleasing if they are brought fresh to the table, others, if after long feeding and forced fattening\nthey almost melt and can hardly retain their own grease. You like the subtly devised flavour of these\ndishes. But I assure you that such carefully chosen and variously seasoned dishes, once they have\nentered the belly, will be overtaken alike by one and the same corruption. Would you despise the\npleasures of eating? Then consider its result! I remember some words of Attalus, which elicited\ngeneral applause:", "\"Riches long deceived me. I used to be dazed when I caught some gleam of them here and there. I\nused to think that their hidden influence matched their visible show. But once, at a certain elaborate\nentertainment, I saw embossed work in silver and gold equalling the wealth of a whole city, and\ncolours and tapestry devised to match objects which surpassed the value of gold or of silver ?\nbrought not only from beyond our own borders, but from beyond the borders of our enemies; on one\nside were slave-boys notable for their training and beauty, on the other were throngs of\nslave-women, and all the other resources that a prosperous and mighty empire could offer after\nreviewing its possessions. What else is this, I said to myself, than a stirring-up of man's cravings,\nwhich are in themselves provocative of lust? What is the meaning of all this display of money? Did\nwe gather merely to learn what greed was? For my own part I left the place with less craving than I\nhad when I entered. I came to despise riches, not because of their uselessness, but because of their\npettiness. Have you noticed how, inside a few hours, that programme, however slow-moving and\ncarefully arranged, was over and done? Has a business filled up this whole life of ours, which could\nnot fill up a whole day?", "\"I had another thought also: the riches seemed to me to be as useless to the possessors as they\nwere to the onlookers. Accordingly, I say to myself, whenever a show of that sort dazzles my eyes,\nwhenever I see a splendid palace with a well-groomed corps of attendants and beautiful bearers\ncarrying a litter: Why wonder? Why gape in astonishment? It is all show; such things are displayed,\nnot possessed; while they please they pass away. Turn thyself rather to the true riches. Learn to be\ncontent with little, and cry out with courage and with greatness of soul: 'We have water, we have\nporridge; let us compete in happiness with Jupiter himself.' And why not, I pray thee, make this\nchallenge even without porridge and water? For it is base to make the happy life depend upon silver\nand gold, and just as base to make it depend upon water and porridge. 'But,' some will say, 'what\ncould I do without such things?' Do you ask what is the cure for want? It is to make hunger satisfy\nhunger; for, all else being equal, what difference is there in the smallness or the largeness of the\nthings that force you to be a slave? What matter how little it is that Fortune can refuse to you? Your\nvery porridge and water can fall under another's jurisdiction; and besides, freedom comes, not to\nhim over whom Fortune has slight power, but to him over whom she has no power at all. This is\nwhat I mean: you must crave nothing, if you would vie with Jupiter; for Jupiter craves nothing.\"", "This is what Attalus told us. If you are willing to think often of these things, you will strive not to seem\nhappy, but to be happy, and, in addition, to seem happy to yourself rather than to others. Farewell.", "You have asked me to give you a Latin word for the Greek sophismata. Many have tried to define\nthe term, but no name has stuck. This is natural, inasmuch as the thing itself has not been admitted\nto general use by us; the name, too, has met with opposition. But the word which Cicero used\nseems to me most suitable: he calls them cavillationes. If a man has surrendered himself to them,\nhe weaves many a tricky subtlety, but makes no progress toward real living; he does not thereby\nbecome braver, or more restrained, or loftier of spirit.", "He, however, who has practised philosophy to effect his own cure, becomes high-souled, full of\nconfidence, invincible, and greater as you draw near him. This phenomenon is seen in the case of\nhigh mountains, which appear less lofty when beheld from afar, but which prove clearly how high the\npeaks are when you come near them; such, my dear Lucilius, is our true philosopher, true by his\nacts and not by his tricks. He stands in a high place, worthy of admiration, lofty, and really great. He\ndoes not stretch himself or walk on tiptoe like those who seek to improve their height by deceit,\nwishing to seem taller than they really are; he is content with his own greatness. And why should he\nnot be content with having grown to such a height that Fortune cannot reach her hands to it? He is\ntherefore above earthly things, equal to himself under all conditions, ? whether the current of life\nruns free, or whether he is tossed and travels on troubled and desperate seas; but this\nsteadfastness cannot be gained through such hair-splittings as I have just mentioned. The mind\nplays with them, but profits not a whit; the mind in such cases is simply dragging philosophy down\nfrom her heights to the level ground.", "In my father I observed mildness of temper, and unchangeable resolution in the things which he had\ndetermined after due deliberation; and no vainglory in those things which men call honours; and a\nlove of labour and perseverance; and a readiness to listen to those who had anything to propose for\nthe common weal; and undeviating firmness in giving to every man according to his deserts; and a\nknowledge derived from experience of the occasions for vigorous action and for remission. And I\nobserved that he had overcome all passion for boys; and he considered himself no more than any\nother citizen; and he released his friends from all obligation to sup with him or to attend him of\nnecessity when he went abroad, and those who had failed to accompany him, by reason of any\nurgent circumstances, always found him the same. I observed too his habit of careful inquiry in all\nmatters of deliberation, and his persistency, and that he never stopped his investigation through\nbeing satisfied with appearances which first present themselves; and that his disposition was to\nkeep his friends, and not to be soon tired of them, nor yet to be extravagant in his affection; and to\nbe satisfied on all occasions, and cheerful; and to foresee things a long way off, and to provide for\nthe smallest without display; and to check immediately popular applause and all flattery; and to be\never watchful over the things which were necessary for the administration of the empire, and to be a\ngood manager of the expenditure, and patiently to endure the blame which he got for such conduct;\nand he was neither superstitious with respect to the gods, nor did he court men by gifts or by trying\nto please them, or by flattering the populace; but he showed sobriety in all things and firmness, and\nnever any mean thoughts or action, nor love of novelty. And the things which conduce in any way to\nthe commodity of life, and of which fortune gives an abundant supply, he used without arrogance\nand without excusing himself; so that when he had them, he enjoyed them without affectation, and\nwhen he had them not, he did not want them. No one could ever say of him that he was either a\nsophist or a home-bred flippant slave or a pedant; but every one acknowledged him to be a man\nripe, perfect, above flattery, able to manage his own and other men's affairs. Besides this, he\nhonoured those who were true philosophers, and he did not reproach those who pretended to be\nphilosophers, nor yet was he easily led by them. He was also easy in conversation, and he made", "himself agreeable without any offensive affectation. He took a reasonable care of his body's health,\nnot as one who was greatly attached to life, nor out of regard to personal appearance, nor yet in a\ncareless way, but so that, through his own attention, he very seldom stood in need of the physician's\nart or of medicine or external applications. He was most ready to give way without envy to those\nwho possessed any particular faculty, such as that of eloquence or knowledge of the law or of\nmorals, or of anything else; and he gave them his help, that each might enjoy reputation according\nto his deserts; and he always acted conformably to the institutions of his country, without showing\nany affectation of doing so. Further, he was not fond of change nor unsteady, but he loved to stay in\nthe same places, and to employ himself about the same things; and after his paroxysms of\nheadache he came immediately fresh and vigorous to his usual occupations. His secrets were not\nbut very few and very rare, and these only about public matters; and he showed prudence and\neconomy in the exhibition of the public spectacles and the construction of public buildings, his\ndonations to the people, and in such things, for he was a man who looked to what ought to be done,\nnot to the reputation which is got by a man's acts. He did not take the bath at unseasonable hours;\nhe was not fond of building houses, nor curious about what he ate, nor about the texture and colour\nof his clothes, nor about the beauty of his slaves. His dress came from Lorium, his villa on the coast,\nand from Lanuvium generally. We know how he behaved to the toll-collector at Tusculum who asked\nhis pardon; and such was all his behaviour. There was in him nothing harsh, nor implacable, nor\nviolent, nor, as one may say, anything carried to the sweating point; but he examined all things\nseverally, as if he had abundance of time, and without confusion, in an orderly way, vigorously and\nconsistently. And that might be applied to him which is recorded of Socrates, that he was able both\nto abstain from, and to enjoy, those things which many are too weak to abstain from, and cannot\nenjoy without excess. But to be strong enough both to bear the one and to be sober in the other is\nthe mark of a man who has a perfect and invincible soul, such as he showed in the illness of\nMaximus.", "The reason which governs knows what its own disposition is, and what it does, and on what material\nit works.", "I would not forbid you to practise such exercises occasionally; but let it be at a time when you wish\nto do nothing. The worst feature, however, that these indulgences present is that they acquire a sort\nof self-made charm, occupying and holding the soul by a show of subtlety; although such weighty\nmatters claim our attention, and a whole life seems scarcely sufficient to learn the single principle of\ndespising life. \"What? Did you not mean 'control' instead of 'despise'\"? No; \"controlling\" is the\nsecond task; for no one has controlled his life aright unless he has first learned to despise it.\nFarewell.", "I am indeed anxious that your friend be moulded and trained, according to your desire. But he has\nbeen taken in a very hardened state, or rather (and this is a more difficult problem), in a very soft\nstate, broken down by bad and inveterate habits.", "I should like to give you an illustration from my own handicraft. It is not every vine that admits the\ngrafting process; if it be old and decayed, or if it be weak and slender, the vine either will not receive\nthe cutting, or will not nourish it and make it a part of itself, nor will it accommodate itself to the\nqualities and nature of the grafted part. Hence we usually cut off the vine above ground, so that if we\ndo not get results at first, we may try a second venture, and on a second trial graft it below the\nground.", "Now this person, concerning whom you have sent me your message in writing, has no strength; for\nhe has pampered his vices. He has at one and the same time become flabby and hardened. He\ncannot receive reason, nor can he nourish it. \"But,\" you say, \"he desires reason of his own free will.\"\nDon't believe him. Of course I do not mean that he is lying to you; for he really thinks that he desires\nit. Luxury has merely upset his stomach; he will soon become reconciled to it again. \"But he says\nthat he is put out with his former way of living.\" Very likely. Who is not? Men love and hate their\nvices at the same time. It will be the proper season to pass judgment on him when he has given us\na guarantee that he really hates luxury; as it is now, luxury and he are merely not on speaking\nterms. Farewell.", "You wish me to write to you my opinion concerning this question, which has been mooted by our\nschool ? whether justice, courage, foresight, and the other virtues, are living things. By such niceties\nas this, my beloved Lucilius, we have made people think that we sharpen our wits on useless\nobjects, and waste our leisure time in discussions that will be unprofitable. I shall, however, do as\nyou ask, and shall set forth the subject as viewed by our school. For myself, I confess to another\nbelief: I hold that there are certain things which befit a wearer of white shoes and a Greek mantle.\nBut what the beliefs are that have stirred the ancients, or those which the ancients have stirred up\nfor discussion, I shall explain to you.", "The soul, men are agreed, is a living thing, because of itself it can make us living things, and\nbecause \"living things\" have derived their name therefrom. But virtue is nothing else than a soul in a\ncertain condition; therefore it is a living thing. Again, virtue is active, and no action can take place\nwithout impulse. And if a thing has impulse, it must be a living thing; for none except a living thing\npossesses impulse. A reply to this is: \"If virtue is a living thing, then virtue itself possesses virtue.\" Of\ncourse it possesses its own self! Just as the wise man does everything by reason of virtue, so virtue\naccomplishes everything by reason of itself. \"In that case,\" say they, \"all the arts also are living\nthings, and all our thoughts and all that the mind comprehends. It therefore follows that many\nthousands of living things dwell in man's tiny heart, and that each individual among us consists of, or\nat least contains, many living beings.\"", "Are you gravelled for an answer to this remark? Each of these will be a living thing; but they will not\nbe many separate living things. And why? I shall explain, if you will apply your subtlety and your\nconcentration to my words. Each living thing must have a separate substance; but since all the\nthings mentioned above have a single soul, consequently they can be separate living things but\nwithout plurality. I myself am a living thing, and a man; but you cannot say that there are two of me\nfor that reason. And why? Because, if that were so, they would have to be two separate existences.\nThis is what I mean: one would have to be sundered from the other so as to produce two. But\nwhenever you have that which is manifold in one whole, it falls into the category of a single nature,\nand is therefore single.", "My soul is a living thing, and so am I; but we are not two separate persons. And why? Because the\nsoul is part of myself. It will only be reckoned as a definite thing in itself, when it shall exist by itself.\nBut as long as it shall be part of another, it cannot be regarded as different. And why? I will tell you:\nit is because that which is different, must be personal and peculiar to itself, a whole, and complete\nwithin itself. I myself have gone on record as being of a different opinion; for if one adopts this belief,\nnot only the virtues will be living things, but so will their contrary vices, and the emotions, like wrath,\nfear, grief, and suspicion. Nay, the argument will carry us still further ? all opinions and all thoughts\nwill be living things. This is by no means admissible; since anything that man does is not necessarily\nthe man himself. \"What is Justice?\" people say. Justice is a soul that maintains itself in a certain\nattitude. \"Then if the soul is a living being, so is Justice.\" By no means. For Justice is really a state, a\nkind of power, of the soul; and this same soul is transformed into various likenesses and does not\nbecome a different kind of living thing as often as it acts differently. Nor is the result of soul-action a\nliving thing. If Justice, Bravery, and the other virtues have actual life, do they cease to be living\nthings and then begin life over again, or are they always living things?", "But the virtues cannot cease to be. Therefore, there are many, nay countless, living things,\nsojourning in this one soul. \"No,\" is the answer, \"not many, because they are all attached to the one,\nbeing parts and members of a single whole.\" We are then portraying for ourselves an image of the\nsoul like that of a many-headed hydra ? each separate head fighting and destroying independently.\nAnd yet there is no separate living thing to each head; it is the head of a living thing, and the hydra\nitself is one single living thing. No one ever believed that the Chimaera contained a living lion or a\nliving serpent; these were merely parts of the whole Chimaera; and parts are not living things. Then\nhow can you infer that Justice is a living thing? \"Justice,\" people reply, \"is active and helpful; that\nwhich acts and is helpful, possesses impulse; and that which possesses impulse is a living thing.\"\nTrue, if the impulse is its own; (but in the case of justice it is not its own;) the impulse comes from\nthe soul. Every living thing exists as it began, until death; a man, until he dies, is a man, a horse is a\nhorse, a dog a dog. They cannot change into anything else. Now let us grant that Justice ? which is\ndefined as \"a soul in a certain attitude,\" is a living thing. Let us suppose this to be so. Then Bravery\nalso is alive, being \"a soul in a certain attitude.\" But which soul? That which was but now defined as\nJustice? The soul is kept within the first-named being, and cannot cross over into another; it must\nlast out its existence in the medium where it had its origin. Besides, there cannot be one soul to two\nliving things, much less to many living things. And if Justice, Bravery, Restraint, and all the other\nvirtues, are living things, how will they have one soul? They must possess separate souls, or else\nthey are not living things. Several living things cannot have one body; this is admitted by our very\nopponents. Now what is the \"body\" of justice? \"The soul,\" they admit. And of bravery? \"The soul\nalso.\" And yet there cannot be one body of two living things. \"The same soul, however,\" they\nanswer, \"assumes the guise of Justice, or Bravery, or Restraint.\" This would be possible if Bravery\nwere absent when Justice was present, and if Restraint were absent when Bravery was present; as\nthe case stands now, all the virtues exist at the same time. Hence, how can the separate virtues be\nliving things, if you grant that there is one single soul, which cannot create more than one single\nliving thing?", "Again, no living thing is part of another living thing. But Justice is a part of the soul; therefore Justice\nis not a living thing. It looks as if I were wasting time over something that is an acknowledged fact;\nfor one ought to decry such a topic rather than debate it. And no two living things are equal.\nConsider the bodies of all beings: every one has its particular colour, shape, and size. And among\nthe other reasons for marvelling at the genius of the Divine Creator is, I believe, this, ? that amid all\nthis abundance there is no repetition; even seemingly similar things are, on comparison, unlike. God\nhas created all the great number of leaves that we behold: each, however, is stamped with its\nspecial pattern. All the many animals: none resembles another in size ? always some difference!\nThe Creator has set himself the task of making unlike and unequal things that are different; but all\nthe virtues, as your argument states, are equal. Therefore, they are not living things.", "The best way of avenging thyself is not to become like the wrong doer.", "Every living thing acts of itself; but virtue does nothing of itself; it must act in conjunction with man.\nAll living things either are gifted with reason, like men and gods, or else are irrational, like beasts\nand cattle. Virtues, in any case, are rational; and yet they are neither men nor gods; therefore they\nare not living things. Every living thing possessed of reason is inactive if it is not first stirred by some\nexternal impression; then the impulse comes, and finally assent confirms the impulse. Now what\nassent is, I shall explain. Suppose that I ought to take a walk: I do walk, but only after uttering the\ncommand to myself and approving this opinion of mine. Or suppose that I ought to seat myself; I do\nseat myself, but only after the same process. This assent is not a part of virtue. For let us suppose\nthat it is Prudence; how will Prudence assent to the opinion: \"I must take a walk\"? Nature does not\nallow this. For Prudence looks after the interests of its possessor, and not of its own self. Prudence\ncannot walk or be seated. Accordingly, it does not possess the power of assent, and it is not a living\nthing possessed of reason. But if virtue is a living thing, it is rational. But it is not rational; therefore it\nis not a living thing. If virtue is a living thing, and virtue is a Good ? is not, then, every Good a living\nthing? It is. Our school professes it.", "Now to save a father's life is a Good; it is also a Good to pronounce one's opinion judiciously in the\nsenate, and it is a Good to hand down just opinions; therefore the act of saving a father's life is a\nliving thing, also the act of pronouncing judicious opinions. We have carried this absurd argument so\nfar that you cannot keep from laughing outright: wise silence is a Good, and so is a frugal dinner;\ntherefore silence and dining are living things. Indeed I shall never cease to tickle my mind and to\nmake sport for myself by means of this nice nonsense. Justice and Bravery, if they are living things,\nare certainly of the earth. Now every earthly living thing gets cold or hungry or thirsty; therefore,\nJustice goes a-cold, Bravery is hungry, and Kindness craves a drink!", "And what next? Should I not ask our honourable opponents what shape these living beings have? Is\nit that of man, or horse, or wild beast? If they are given a round shape, like that of a god, I shall ask\nwhether greed and luxury and madness are equally round. For these, too, are \"living things.\" If I find\nthat they give a rounded shape to these also, I shall go so far as to ask whether a modest gait is a\nliving thing; they must admit it, according to their argument, and proceed to say that a gait is a living\nthing, and a rounded living thing, at that!", "Now do not imagine that I am the first one of our school who does not speak from rules but has his\nown opinion: Cleanthes and his pupil Chrysippus could not agree in defining the act of walking.\nCleanthes held that it was spirit transmitted to the feet from the primal essence, while Chrysippus\nmaintained that it was the primal essence in itself. Why, then, following the example of Chrysippus\nhimself, should not every man claim his own freedom, and laugh down all these \"living things,\" ? so\nnumerous that the universe itself cannot contain them? One might say: \"The virtues are not many\nliving things, and yet they are living things. For just as an individual may be both poet and orator in\none, even so these virtues are living things, but they are not many. The soul is the same; it can be at\nthe same time just and prudent and brave, maintaining itself in a certain attitude towards each\nvirtue.\" The dispute is settled, and we are therefore agreed. For I shall admit, meanwhile, that the\nsoul is a living thing with the proviso that later on I may cast my final vote; but I deny that the acts of\nthe soul are living beings. Otherwise, all words and all verses would be alive; for if prudent speech is\na Good, and every Good a living thing, then speech is a living thing. A prudent line of poetry is a\nGood; everything alive is a Good; therefore, the line of poetry is a living thing. And so \"Arms and the\nman I sing,\" is a living thing; but they cannot call it rounded, because it has six feet! \"This whole\nproposition,\" you say, \"which we are at this moment discussing, is a puzzling fabric.\" I split with\nlaughter whenever I reflect that solecisms and barbarisms and syllogisms are living things, and, like\nan artist, I give to each a fitting likeness. Is this what we discuss with contracted brow and wrinkled\nforehead? I cannot say now, after Caelius, \"What melancholy trifling!\" It is more than this; it is\nabsurd. Why do we not rather discuss something which is useful and wholesome to ourselves,\nseeking how we may attain the virtues, and finding the path which will take us in that direction?", "Teach me, not whether Bravery be a living thing, but prove that no living thing is happy without\nbravery, that is, unless it has grown strong to oppose hazards and has overcome all the strokes of\nchance by rehearsing and anticipating their attack. And what is Bravery? It is the impregnable\nfortress for our mortal weakness; when a man has surrounded himself therewith, he can hold out\nfree from anxiety during life's siege; for he is using his own strength and his own weapons. At this\npoint I would quote you a saying of our philosopher Posidonius: \"There are never any occasions\nwhen you need think yourself safe because you wield the weapons of Fortune; fight with your own!\nFortune does not furnish arms against herself; hence men equipped against their foes are unarmed\nagainst Fortune herself.\"", "Alexander, to be sure, harried and put to flight the Persians, the Hyrcanians, the Indians, and all the\nother races that the Orient spreads even to the Ocean; but he himself, as he slew one friend or lost\nanother, would lie in the darkness lamenting sometimes his crime, and sometimes his loss; he, the\nconqueror of so many kings and nations, was laid low by anger and grief! For he had made it his aim\nto win control over everything except his emotions. Oh with what great mistakes are men obsessed,\nwho desire to push their limits of empire beyond the seas, who judge themselves most prosperous\nwhen they occupy many provinces with their soldiery and join new territory to the old! Little do they\nknow of that kingdom which is on an equality with the heavens in greatness! Self-Command is the\ngreatest command of all. Let her teach me what a hallowed thing is the Justice which ever regards\nanother's good and seeks nothing for itself except its own employment. It should have nothing to do\nwith ambition and reputation; it should satisfy itself.", "Let each man convince himself of this before all else ? \"I must be just without reward.\" And that is\nnot enough; let him convince himself also of this: \"May I take pleasure in devoting myself of my own\nfree will to uphold this noblest of virtues.\" Let all his thoughts be turned as far as possible from\npersonal interests. You need not look about for the reward of a just deed; a just deed in itself offers\na still greater return. Fasten deep in your mind that which I remarked a short space above: that it\nmakes no difference how many persons are acquainted with your uprightness. Those who wish their\nvirtue to be advertised are not striving for virtue but for renown. Are you not willing to be just without\nbeing renowned? Nay, indeed you must often be just and be at the same time disgraced. And then,\nif you are wise, let ill repute, well won, be a delight. Farewell.", "You have been asking me why, during certain periods, a degenerate style of speech comes to the\nfore, and how it is that men's wits have gone downhill into certain vices ? in such a way that\nexposition at one time has taken on a kind of puffed-up strength, and at another has become\nmincing and modulated like the music of a concert piece. You wonder why sometimes bold ideas ?\nbolder than one could believe ? have been held in favour, and why at other times one meets with\nphrases that are disconnected and full of innuendo, into which one must read more meaning than\nwas intended to meet the ear. Or why there have been epochs which maintained the right to a\nshameless use of metaphor. For answer, here is a phrase which you are wont to notice in the\npopular speech ? one which the Greeks have made into a proverb: \"Man's speech is just like his\nlife.\" Exactly as each individual man's actions seem to speak, so people's style of speaking often\nreproduces the general character of the time, if the morale of the public has relaxed and has given\nitself over to effeminacy. Wantonness in speech is proof of public luxury, if it is popular and\nfashionable, and not confined to one or two individual instances. A man's ability cannot possibly be\nof one sort and his soul of another. If his soul be wholesome, well-ordered, serious, and restrained,\nhis ability also is sound and sober. Conversely, when the one degenerates, the other is also\ncontaminated. Do you not see that if a man's soul has become sluggish, his limbs drag and his feet\nmove indolently? If it is womanish, that one can detect the effeminacy by his very gait? That a keen\nand confident soul quickens the step? That madness in the soul, or anger (which resembles\nmadness), hastens our bodily movements from walking to rushing?", "And how much more do you think that this affects one's ability, which is entirely interwoven with the\nsoul, ? being moulded thereby, obeying its commands, and deriving therefrom its laws! How\nMaecenas lived is too well-known for present comment. We know how he walked, how effeminate\nhe was, and how he desired to display himself; also, how unwilling he was that his vices should\nescape notice. What, then? Does not the looseness of his speech match his ungirt attire? Are his\nhabits, his attendants, his house, his wife, any less clearly marked than his words? He would have\nbeen a man of great powers, had he set himself to his task by a straight path, had he not shrunk\nfrom making himself understood, had he not been so loose in his style of speech also. You will\ntherefore see that his eloquence was that of an intoxicated man ? twisting, turning, unlimited in its\nslackness.", "What is more unbecoming than the words: \"A stream and a bank covered with long-tressed woods\"?\nAnd see how \"men plough the channel with boats and, turning up the shallows, leave gardens\nbehind them.\" Or, \"He curls his lady-locks, and bills and coos, and starts a-sighing, like a forest lord\nwho offers prayers with down-bent neck.\" Or, \"An unregenerate crew, they search out people at\nfeasts, and assail households with the wine-cup, and, by hope, exact death.\" Or, \"A Genius could\nhardly bear witness to his own festival\"; or \"threads of tiny tapers and crackling meal\"; \"mothers or\nwives clothing the hearth.\"", "Take pleasure in one thing and rest in it, in passing from one social act to another social act,\nthinking of God.", "Can you not at once imagine, on reading through these words, that this was the man who always\nparaded through the city with a flowing tunic? For even if he was discharging the absent emperor's\nduties, he was always in undress when they asked him for the countersign. Or that this was the man\nwho, as judge on the bench, or as an orator, or at any public function, appeared with his cloak\nwrapped about his head, leaving only the ears exposed, like the millionaire's runaway slaves in the\nfarce? Or that this was the man who, at the very time when the state was embroiled in civil strife,\nwhen the city was in difficulties and under martial law, was attended in public by two eunuchs ? both\nof them more men than himself? Or that this was the man who had but one wife, and yet was\nmarried countless times? These words of his, put together so faultily, thrown off so carelessly, and\narranged in such marked contrast to the usual practice, declare that the character of their writer was\nequally unusual, unsound, and eccentric. To be sure, we bestow upon him the highest praise for his\nhumanity; he was sparing with the sword and refrained from bloodshed; and he made a show of his\npower only in the course of his loose living; but he spoiled, by such preposterous finickiness of style,\nthis genuine praise, which was his due. For it is evident that he was not really gentle, but effeminate,\nas is proved by his misleading word-order, his inverted expressions, and the surprising thoughts\nwhich frequently contain something great, but in finding expression have become nerveless. One\nwould say that his head was turned by too great success.", "This fault is due sometimes to the man, and sometimes to his epoch. When prosperity has spread\nluxury far and wide, men begin by paying closer attention to their personal appearance. Then they\ngo crazy over furniture. Next, they devote attention to their houses ? how to take up more space\nwith them, as if they were country-houses, how to make the walls glitter with marble that has been\nimported over seas, how to adorn a roof with gold, so that it may match the brightness of the inlaid\nfloors. After that, they transfer their exquisite taste to the dinner-table, attempting to court approval\nby novelty and by departures from the customary order of dishes, so that the courses which we are\naccustomed to serve at the end of the meal may be served first, and so that the departing guests\nmay partake of the kind of food which in former days was set before them on their arrival.", "When the mind has acquired the habit of scorning the usual things of life, and regarding as mean\nthat which was once customary, it begins to hunt for novelties in speech also; now it summons and\ndisplays obsolete and old-fashioned words; now it coins even unknown words or misshapes them;\nand now a bold and frequent metaphorical usage is made a special feature of style, according to the\nfashion which has just become prevalent. Some cut the thoughts short, hoping to make a good\nimpression by leaving the meaning in doubt and causing the hearer to suspect his own lack of wit.\nSome dwell upon them and lengthen them out. Others, too, approach just short of a fault ? for a\nman must really do this if he hopes to attain an imposing effect ? but actually love the fault for its\nown sake. In short, whenever you notice that a degenerate style pleases the critics, you may be\nsure that character also has deviated from the right standard.", "Just as luxurious banquets and elaborate dress are indications of disease in the state, similarly a lax\nstyle, if it be popular, shows that the mind (which is the source of the word) has lost its balance.\nIndeed you ought not to wonder that corrupt speech is welcomed not merely by the more squalid\nmob but also by our more cultured throng; for it is only in their dress and not in their judgments that\nthey differ. You may rather wonder that not only the effects of vices, but even vices themselves,\nmeet with approval. For it has ever been thus: no man's ability has ever been approved without\nsomething being pardoned. Show me any man, however famous; I can tell you what it was that his\nage forgave in him, and what it was that his age purposely overlooked. I can show you many men\nwhose vices have caused them no harm, and not a few who have been even helped by these vices.\nYes, I will show you persons of the highest reputation, set up as models for our admiration; and yet\nif you seek to correct their errors, you destroy them; for vices are so intertwined with virtues that they\ndrag the virtues along with them. Moreover, style has no fixed laws; it is changed by the usage of\nthe people, never the same for any length of time. Many orators hark back to earlier epochs for their\nvocabulary, speaking in the language of the Twelve Tables. Gracchus, Crassus, and Curio, in their\neyes, are too refined and too modern; so back to Appius and Coruncanius! Conversely, certain men,\nin their endeavour to maintain nothing but well-worn and common usages, fall into a humdrum style.\nThese two classes, each in its own way, are degenerate; and it is no less degenerate to use no\nwords except those which are conspicuous, high-sounding, and poetical, avoiding what is familiar\nand in ordinary usage.

In this department, what countless varieties of fault I\ncan show you! Some are all for abruptness and unevenness of style, purposely disarranging\nanything which seems to have a smooth flow of language. They would have jolts in all their\ntransitions; they regard as strong and manly whatever makes an uneven impression on the ear. With\nsome others it is not so much an \"arrangement\" of words as it is a setting to music; so wheedling\nand soft is their gliding style. And what shall I say of that arrangement in which words are put off\nand, after being long waited for, just manage to come in at the end of a period? Or again of that\nsoftly-concluding style, Cicero-fashion, with a gradual and gently poised descent always the same\nand always with the customary arrangement of the rhythm! Nor is the fault only in the style of the\nsentences, if they are either petty and childish, or debasing, with more daring than modesty should\nallow, or if they are flowery and cloying, or if they end in emptiness, accomplishing mere sound and\nnothing more.", "Some individual makes these vices fashionable ? some person who controls the eloquence of the\nday; the rest follow his lead and communicate the habit to each other. Thus when Sallust was in his\nglory, phrases were lopped off, words came to a close unexpectedly, and obscure conciseness was\nequivalent to elegance. L. Arruntius, a man of rare simplicity, author of a historical work on the Punic\nWar, was a member and a strong supporter of the Sallust school. There is a phrase in Sallust:\nexercitum argento fecit, meaning thereby that he recruited an army by means of money. Arruntius\nbegan to like this idea; he therefore inserted the verb facio all through his book. Hence, in one\npassage, fugam nostris fecere; in another, Hiero, rex Syracusanorum, bellum fecit; and in another,\nquae audita Panhormitanos dedere Romanis fecere. I merely desired to give you a taste; his whole\nbook is interwoven with such stuff as this. What Sallust reserved for occasional use, Arruntius\nmakes into a frequent and almost continual habit ? and there was a reason: for Sallust used the\nwords as they occurred to his mind, while the other writer went afield in search of them. So you see\nthe results of copying another man's vices. Again, Sallust said: aquis hiemantibus. Arruntius, in his\nfirst book on the Punic War, uses the words: repente hiemavit tempestas. And elsewhere, wishing to\ndescribe an exceptionally cold year, he says: totus hiemavit annus. And in another passage: inde\nsexaginta onerarias leves praeter militem et necessarios nautarum hiemante aquilone misit; and he\ncontinues to bolster many passages with this metaphor. In a certain place, Sallust gives the words:\ninter arma civilia aequi bonique famas petit; and Arruntius cannot restrain himself from mentioning at\nonce, in the first book, that there were extensive \"reminders\" concerning Regulus.", "These and similar faults, which imitation stamps upon one's style, are not necessarily indications of\nloose standards or of debased mind; for they are bound to be personal and peculiar to the writer,\nenabling one to judge thereby of a particular author's temperament; just as an angry man will talk in\nan angry way, an excitable man in a flurried way, and an effeminate man in a style that is soft and\nunresisting. You note this tendency in those who pluck out, or thin out, their beards, or who closely\nshear and shave the upper lip while preserving the rest of the hair and allowing it to grow, or in\nthose who wear cloaks of outlandish colours, who wear transparent togas, and who never deign to\ndo anything which will escape general notice; they endeavour to excite and attract men's attention,\nand they put up even with censure, provided that they can advertise themselves. That is the style of\nMaecenas and all the others who stray from the path, not by hazard, but consciously and voluntarily.\nThis is the result of great evil in the soul. As in the case of drink, the tongue does not trip until the\nmind is overcome beneath its load and gives way or betrays itself; so that intoxication of style ? for\nwhat else than this can I call it? ? never gives trouble to anyone unless the soul begins to totter.\nTherefore, I say, take care of the soul; for from the soul issue our thoughts, from the soul our words,\nfrom the soul our dispositions, our expressions, and our very gait. When the soul is sound and\nstrong, the style too is vigorous, energetic, manly; but if the soul lose its balance, down comes all\nthe rest in ruins.", "The soul is our king. If it be safe, the other functions remain on duty and serve with obedience; but\nthe slightest lack of equilibrium in the soul causes them to waver along with it. And when the soul\nhas yielded to pleasure, its functions and actions grow weak, and any undertaking comes from a\nnerveless and unsteady source. To persist in my use of this simile ? our soul is at one time a king, at\nanother a tyrant. The king, in that he respects things honourable, watches over the welfare of the\nbody which is entrusted to his charge, and gives that body no base, no ignoble commands. But an\nuncontrolled, passionate, and effeminate soul changes kingship into that most dread and detestable\nquality ? tyranny; then it becomes a prey to the uncontrolled emotions, which dog its steps, elated at\nfirst, to be sure, like a populace idly sated with a largess which will ultimately be its undoing, and\nspoiling what it cannot consume. But when the disease has gradually eaten away the strength, and\nluxurious habits have penetrated the marrow and the sinews, such a soul exults at the sight of limbs\nwhich, through its overindulgence, it has made useless; instead of its own pleasures, it views those\nof others; it becomes the go-between and witness of the passions which, as the result of\nself-gratification, it can no longer feel. Abundance of delights is not so pleasing a thing to that soul\nas it is bitter, because it cannot send all the dainties of yore down through the over-worked throat\nand stomach, because it can no longer whirl in the maze of eunuchs and mistresses, and it is\nmelancholy because a great part of its happiness is shut off, through the limitations of the body.", "Now is it not madness, Lucilius, for none of us to reflect that he is mortal? Or frail? Or again that he\nis but one individual? Look at our kitchens, and the cooks, who bustle about over so many fires; is it,\nthink you, for a single belly that all this bustle and preparation of food takes place? Look at the old\nbrands of wine and store-houses filled with the vintages of many ages; is it, think you, a single belly\nthat is to receive the stored wine, sealed with the names of so many consuls, and gathered from so\nmany vineyards? Look, and mark in how many regions men plough the earth, and how many\nthousands of farmers are tilling and digging; is it, think you, for a single belly that crops are planted\nin Sicily and Africa? We should be sensible, and our wants more reasonable, if each of us were to\ntake stock of himself, and to measure his bodily needs also, and understand how little he can\nconsume, and for how short a time! But nothing will give you so much help toward moderation as the\nfrequent thought that life is short and uncertain here below; whatever you are doing, have regard to\ndeath. Farewell.", "The ruling principle is that which rouses and turns itself, and while it makes itself such as it is and\nsuch as it wills to be, it also makes everything which happens appear to itself to be such as it wills.", "I wish, my dear Lucilius, that you would not be too particular with regard to words and their\narrangement; I have greater matters than these to commend to your care. You should seek what to\nwrite, rather than how to write it ? and even that not for the purpose of writing but of feeling it, that\nyou may thus make what you have felt more your own and, as it were, set a seal on it. Whenever\nyou notice a style that is too careful and too polished, you may be sure that the mind also is no less\nabsorbed in petty things. The really great man speaks informally and easily; whatever he says, he\nspeaks with assurance rather than with pains.", "You are familiar with the young dandies, natty as to their beards and locks, fresh from the bandbox;\nyou can never expect from them any strength or any soundness. Style is the garb of thought: if it be\ntrimmed, or dyed, or treated, it shows that there are defects and a certain amount of flaws in the\nmind. Elaborate elegance is not a manly garb. If we had the privilege of looking into a good man's\nsoul, oh what a fair, holy, magnificent, gracious, and shining face should we behold ? radiant on the\none side with justice and temperance, on another with bravery and wisdom! And, besides these,\nthriftiness, moderation, endurance, refinement, affability, and ? though hard to believe ? love of\none's fellow-men, that Good which is so rare in man, all these would be shedding their own glory\nover that soul. There, too, forethought combined with elegance and, resulting from these, a most\nexcellent greatness of soul (the noblest of all these virtues) ? indeed what charm, O ye heavens,\nwhat authority and dignity would they contribute! What a wonderful combination of sweetness and\npower! No one could call such a face lovable without also calling it worshipful. If one might behold\nsuch a face, more exalted and more radiant than the mortal eye is wont to behold, would not one\npause as if struck dumb by a visitation from above, and utter a silent prayer, saying: \"May it be\nlawful to have looked upon it!\"? And then, led on by the encouraging kindliness of his expression,\nshould we not bow down and worship? Should we not, after much contemplation of a far superior\ncountenance, surpassing those which we are wont to look upon, mild-eyed and yet flashing with\nlife-giving fire ? should we not then, I say, in reverence and awe, give utterance to those famous\nlines of our poet Vergil:", "Than mortal, and thy voice rings sweeter far\nThan mortal man's; . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nBlest be thou; and, whoe'er thou art, relieve\nOur heavy burdens.", "And such a vision will indeed be a present help and relief to us, if we are willing to worship it.

If, however, as certain drugs are wont to be\nused for sharpening and clearing the eyesight, we are likewise willing to free our mind's eye from\nhindrances, we shall then be able to perceive virtue, though it be buried in the body ? even though\npoverty stand in the way, and even though lowliness and disgrace block the path. We shall then, I\nsay, behold that true beauty, no matter if it be smothered by unloveliness. Conversely, we shall get\na view of evil and the deadening influences of a sorrow-laden soul ? in spite of the hindrance that\nresults from the widespread gleam of riches that flash round about, and in spite of the false light ? of\nofficial position\non the one side or great power on the other ? which beats pitilessly upon the beholder.", "Then it will be in our power to understand how contemptible are the things we admire ? like children\nwho regard every toy as a thing of value, who cherish necklaces bought at the price of a mere\npenny as more dear than their parents or than their brothers. And what, then, as Aristo says, is the\ndifference between ourselves and these children, except that we elders go crazy over paintings and\nsculpture, and that our folly costs us dearer? Children are pleased by the smooth and variegated\npebbles which they pick up on the beach, while we take delight in tall columns of veined marble\nbrought either from Egyptian sands or from African deserts to hold up a colonnade or a dining-hall\nlarge enough to contain a city crowd; we admire walls veneered with a thin layer of marble, although\nwe know the while what defects the marble conceals. We cheat our own eyesight, and when we\nhave overlaid our ceilings with gold, what else is it but a lie in which we take such delight? For we\nknow that beneath all this gilding there lurks some ugly wood.", "Nor is such superficial decoration spread merely over walls and ceilings; nay, all the famous men\nwhom you see strutting about with head in air, have nothing but a gold-leaf prosperity. Look\nbeneath, and you will know how much evil lies under that thin coating of titles. Note that very\ncommodity which holds the attention of so many magistrates and so many judges, and which\ncreates both magistrates and judges ? that money, I say, which ever since it began to be regarded\nwith respect, has caused the ruin of the true honour of things; we become alternately merchants and\nmerchandise, and we ask, not what a thing truly is, but what it costs; we fulfil duties if it pays, or\nneglect them if it pays, and we follow an honourable course as long as it encourages our\nexpectations, ready to veer across to the opposite course if crooked conduct shall promise more.\nOur parents have instilled into us a respect for gold and silver; in our early years the craving has\nbeen implanted, settling deep within us and growing with our growth. Then too the whole nation,\nthough at odds on every other subject, agrees upon this; this is what they regard, this is what they\nask for their children, this is what they dedicate to the gods when they wish to show their gratitude ?\nas if it were the greatest of all man's possessions!

But Euripides\njumped to his feet, claimed a hearing, and asked them to wait for the conclusion and see the destiny\nthat was in store for this man who gaped after gold. Bellerophon, in that particular drama, was to\npay the penalty which is exacted of all men in the drama of life. For one must pay the penalty for all\ngreedy acts; although the greed is enough of a penalty in itself. What tears and toil does money\nwring from us! Greed is wretched in that which it craves and wretched in that which it wins! Think\nbesides of the daily worry which afflicts every possessor in proportion to the measure of his gain!\nThe possession of riches means even greater agony of spirit than the acquisition of riches. And how\nwe sorrow over our losses ? losses which fall heavily upon us, and yet seem still more heavy! And\nfinally, though Fortune may leave our property intact, whatever we cannot gain in addition, is sheer\nloss!", "\"But,\" you will say to me, \"people call yonder man happy and rich; they pray that some day they may\nequal him in possessions.\" Very true. What, then? Do you think that there is any more pitiable lot in\nlife than to possess misery and hatred also? Would that those who are bound to crave wealth could\ncompare notes with the rich man! Would that those who are bound to seek political office could\nconfer with ambitious men who have reached the most sought-after honours! They would then\nsurely alter their prayers, seeing that these grandees are always gaping after new gain, condemning\nwhat is already behind them. For there is no one in the world who is contented with his prosperity,\neven if it comes to him on the run. Men complain about their plans and the outcome of their plans;\nthey always prefer what they have failed to win.", "So philosophy can settle this problem for you, and afford you, to my mind, the greatest boon that\nexists ? absence of regret for your own conduct. This is a sure happiness; no storm can ruffle it; but\nyou cannot be steered safely through by any subtly woven words, or any gently flowing language.\nLet words proceed as they please, provided only your soul keeps its own sure order, provided your\nsoul is great and holds unruffled to its ideals, pleased with itself on account of the very things which\ndisplease others, a soul that makes life the test of its progress, and believes that its knowledge is in\nexact proportion to its freedom from desire and its freedom from fear. Farewell.", "The universe is either a confusion, and a mutual involution of things, and a dispersion; or it is unity\nand order and providence. If then it is the former, why do I desire to tarry in a fortuitous combination\nof things and such a disorder? And why do I care about anything else than how I shall at last\nbecome earth? And why am I disturbed, for the dispersion of my elements will happen whatever I\ndo. But if the other supposition is true, I venerate, and I am firm, and I trust in him who governs.", "The question has often been raised whether it is better to have moderate emotions, or none at all.\nPhilosophers of our school reject the emotions; the Peripatetics keep them in check. I, however, do\nnot understand how any half-way disease can be either wholesome or helpful. Do not fear; I am not\nrobbing you of any privileges which you are unwilling to lose! I shall be kindly and indulgent towards\nthe objects for which you strive ? those which you hold to be necessary to our existence, or useful,\nor pleasant; I shall simply strip away the vice. For after I have issued my prohibition against the\ndesires, I shall still allow you to wish that you may do the same things fearlessly and with greater\naccuracy of judgment, and to feel even the pleasures more than before; and how can these\npleasures help coming more readily to your call, if you are their lord rather than their slave!", "\"But,\" you object, \"it is natural for me to suffer when I am bereaved of a friend; grant some privileges\nto tears which have the right to flow! It is also natural to be affected by men's opinions and to be cast\ndown when they are unfavourable; so why should you not allow me such an honourable aversion to\nbad opinion?\"", "There is no vice which lacks some plea; there is no vice that at the start is not modest and easily\nentreated; but afterwards the trouble spreads more widely. If you allow it to begin, you cannot make\nsure of its ceasing. Every emotion at the start is weak. Afterwards, it rouses itself and gains strength\nby progress; it is more easy to forestall it than to forgo it. Who does not admit that all the emotions\nflow as it were from a certain natural source? We are endowed by Nature with an interest in our own\nwell-being; but this very interest, when overindulged, becomes a vice. Nature has intermingled\npleasure with necessary things ? not in order that we should seek pleasure, but in order that the\naddition of pleasure may make the indispensable means of existence attractive to our eyes. Should\nit claim rights of its own, it is luxury.", "Let us therefore resist these faults when they are demanding entrance, because, as I have said, it is\neasier to deny them admittance than to make them depart. And if you cry: \"One should be allowed a\ncertain amount of grieving, and a certain amount of fear,\" I reply that the \"certain amount\" can be too\nlong-drawn-out, and that it will refuse to stop short when you so desire. The wise man can safely\ncontrol himself without becoming over-anxious; he can halt his tears and his pleasures at will; but in\nour case, because it is not easy to retrace our steps, it is best not to push ahead at all. I think that\nPanaetius gave a very neat answer to a certain youth who asked him whether the wise man should\nbecome a lover: \"As to the wise man, we shall see later; but you and I, who are as yet far removed\nfrom wisdom, should not trust ourselves to fall into a state that is disordered, uncontrolled, enslaved\nto another, contemptible to itself. If our love be not spurned, we are excited by its kindness; if it be\nscorned, we are kindled by our pride. An easily-won love hurts us as much as one which is difficult\nto win; we are captured by that which is compliant, and we struggle with that which is hard.\nTherefore, knowing our weakness, let us remain quiet. Let us not expose this unstable spirit to the\ntemptations of drink, or beauty, or flattery, or anything that coaxes and allures.\"", "Now that which Panaetius replied to the question about love may be applied, I believe, to all the\nemotions. In so far as we are able, let us step back from slippery places; even on dry ground it is\nhard enough to take a sturdy stand. At this point, I know, you will confront me with that common\ncomplaint against the Stoics: \"Your promises are too great, and your counsels too hard. We are\nmere manikins, unable to deny ourselves everything. We shall sorrow, but not to any great extent;\nwe shall feel desires, but in moderation; we shall give way to anger, but we shall be appeased.\" And\ndo you know why we have not the power to attain this Stoic ideal? It is because we refuse to believe\nin our power. Nay, of a surety, there is something else which plays a part: it is because we are in\nlove with our vices; we uphold them and prefer to make excuses for them rather than shake them\noff. We mortals have been endowed with sufficient strength by nature, if only we use this strength, if\nonly we concentrate our powers and rouse them all to help us or at least not to hinder us. The\nreason is unwillingness, the excuse, inability. Farewell.", "You will be fabricating much trouble for me, and you will be unconsciously embroiling me in a great\ndiscussion, and in considerable bother, if you put such petty questions as these; for in settling them I\ncannot disagree with my fellow-Stoics without impairing my standing among them, nor can I\nsubscribe to such ideas without impairing my conscience. Your query is, whether the Stoic belief is\ntrue: that wisdom is a Good, but that being wise is not a Good. I shall first set forth the Stoic view,\nand then I shall be bold enough to deliver my own opinion.", "We of the Stoic school believe that the Good is corporeal, because the Good is active, and whatever\nis active is corporeal. That which is good, is helpful. But, in order to be helpful, it must be active; so,\nif it is active, it is corporeal. They (the Stoics) declare that wisdom is a Good; it therefore follows that\none must also call wisdom corporeal. But they do not think that being wise can be rated on the same\nbasis. For it is incorporeal and accessory to something else, in other words, wisdom; hence it is in\nno respect active or helpful.", "\"What, then?\" is the reply; \"Why do we not say that being wise is a Good?\" We do say so; but only\nby referring it to that on which it depends ? in other words, wisdom itself. Let me tell you what\nanswers other philosophers make to these objectors, before I myself begin to form my own creed\nand to take my place entirely on another side. \"Judged in that light,\" they say, \"not even living\nhappily is a Good. Willy nilly, such persons ought to reply that the happy life is a Good, but that\nliving happily is not a Good.\" And this objection is also raised against our school: \"You wish to be\nwise. Therefore, being wise is a thing to be desired. And if it be a thing to be desired it is a Good.\"\nSo our philosophers are forced to twist their words and insert another syllable into the word\n\"desired,\" ? a syllable which our language does not normally allow to be inserted. But, with your\npermission, I shall add it. \"That which is good,\" they say, \"is a thing to be desired; the desirable thing\nis that which falls to our lot after we have attained the Good. For the desirable is not sought as a\nGood; it is an accessory to the Good after the Good has been attained.\"", "I myself do not hold the same view, and I judge that our philosophers have come down to this\nargument because they are already bound by the first link in the chain and for that reason may not\nalter their definition. People are wont to concede much to the things which all men take for granted;\nin our eyes the fact that all men agree upon something is a proof of its truth. For instance, we infer\nthat the gods exist, for this reason, among others ? that there is implanted in everyone an idea\nconcerning deity, and there is no people so far beyond the reach of laws and customs that it does\nnot believe at least in gods of some sort. And when we discuss the immortality of the soul, we are\ninfluenced in no small degree by the general opinion of mankind, who either fear or worship the\nspirits of the lower world. I make the most of this general belief: you can find no one who does not\nhold that wisdom is a Good, and being wise also. I shall not appeal to the populace, like a\nconquered gladiator; let us come to close quarters, using our own weapons.", "When something affects a given object, is it outside the object which it affects, or is it inside the\nobject it affects? If it is inside the object it affects, it is as corporeal as the object which it affects. For\nnothing can affect another object without touching it, and that which touches is corporeal. If it is\noutside, it withdraws after having affected the object. And withdrawal means motion. And that which\npossesses\nmotion, is corporeal. You expect me, I suppose, to deny that \"race\" differs from \"running,\" that \"heat\"\ndiffers from \"being hot,\" that \"light\" differs from \"giving light.\" I grant that these pairs vary, but hold\nthat they are not in separate classes. If good health is an indifferent quality, then so is being in good\nhealth; if beauty is an indifferent quality, then so is being beautiful. If justice is a Good, then so is\nbeing just. And if baseness is an evil, then it is an evil to be base ? just as much as, if sore eyes are\nan evil, the state of having sore eyes is also an evil. Neither quality, you may be sure, can exist\nwithout the other. He who is wise is a man of wisdom; he who is a man of wisdom is wise. So true it\nis that we cannot doubt the quality of the one to equal the quality of the other, that they are both\nregarded by certain persons as one and the same.", "When thou hast been compelled by circumstances to be disturbed in a manner, quickly return to\nthyself and do not continue out of tune longer than the compulsion lasts; for thou wilt have more\nmastery over the harmony by continually recurring to it.", "Here is a question, however, which I should be glad to put: granted that all things are either good or\nbad or indifferent ? in what class does being wise belong? People deny that it is a Good; and, as it\nobviously is not an evil, it must consequently be one of the \"media.\" But we mean by the \"medium,\"\nor the \"indifferent\" quality that which can fall to the lot of the bad no less than to the good ? such\nthings as money, beauty, or high social position. But the quality of being wise can fall to the lot of the\ngood man alone; therefore being wise is not an indifferent quality. Nor is it an evil, either; because it\ncannot fall to the lot of the bad man; therefore, it is a Good. That which the good man alone can\npossess, is a Good; now being wise is the possession of the good man only; therefore it is a Good.\nThe objector replies: \"It is only an accessory of wisdom.\" Very well, then, I say, this quality which\nyou call being wise ? does it actively produce wisdom, or is it a passive concomitant of wisdom? It is\ncorporeal in either case. For that which is acted upon and that which acts, are alike corporeal; and, if\ncorporeal, each is a Good. The only quality which could prevent it from being a Good, would be\nincorporeality.", "The Peripatetics believe that there is no distinction between wisdom and being wise, since either of\nthese implies the other also. Now do you suppose that any man can be wise except one who\npossesses wisdom? Or that anyone who is wise does not possess wisdom? The old masters of\ndialectic, however, distinguish between these two conceptions; and from them the classification has\ncome right down to the Stoics. What sort of a classification this is, I shall explain: A field is one thing,\nand the possession of the field another thing; of course, because \"possessing the field\" refers to the\npossessor rather than to the field itself. Similarly, wisdom is one thing and being wise another. You\nwill grant, I suppose, that these two are separate ideas ? the possessed and the possessor: wisdom\nbeing that which one possesses, and he who is wise its possessor. Now wisdom is Mind perfected\nand developed to the highest and best degree. For it is the art of life. And what is being wise? I\ncannot call it \"Mind Perfected,\" but rather that which falls to the lot of him who possesses a \"mind\nperfected\"; thus a good mind is one thing, and the so-called possession of a good mind another.", "\"There are,\" it is said, \"certain natural classes of bodies; we say: 'This is a man,' 'this is a horse.'\nThen there attend on the bodily natures certain movements of the mind which declare something\nabout the body. And these have a certain essential quality which is sundered from body; for\nexample: 'I see Cato walking.' The senses indicate this, and the mind believes it. What I see, is\nbody, and upon this I concentrate my eyes and my mind. Again, I say: 'Cato walks.' What I say,\"\nthey continue, \"is not body; it is a certain declarative fact concerning body ? called variously an\n'utterance,' a 'declaration,' a 'statement.' Thus, when we say 'wisdom,' we mean something\npertaining to body; when we say 'he is wise,' we are speaking concerning body. And it makes\nconsiderable difference whether you mention the person directly, or speak concerning the person.\"", "Supposing for the present that these are two separate conceptions (for I am not yet prepared to give\nmy own opinion); what prevents the existence of still a third ? which is none the less a Good? I\nremarked a little while ago that a \"field\" was one thing, and the \"possession of a field\" another; of\ncourse, for possessor and possessed are of different natures; the latter is the land, and the former is\nthe man who owns the land. But with regard to the point now under discussion, both are of the same\nnature ? the possessor of wisdom, and wisdom itself. Besides, in the one case that which is\npossessed is one thing, and he who possesses it is another; but in this case the possessed and the\npossessor come under the same category. The field is owned by virtue of law, wisdom by virtue of\nnature. The field can change hands and go into the ownership of another; but wisdom never departs\nfrom its owner. Accordingly, there is no reason why you should try to compare things that are so\nunlike one another. I had started to say that these can be two separate conceptions, and yet that\nboth can be Goods ? for instance, wisdom and the wise man being two separate things and yet\ngranted by you to be equally good. And just as there is no objection to regarding both wisdom and\nthe possessor of wisdom as Goods, so there is no objection to regarding as a good both wisdom\nand the possession of wisdom, ? in other words, being wise. For I only wish to be a wise man in\norder to be wise. And what then? Is not that thing a Good without the possession of which a certain\nother thing cannot be a Good? You surely admit that wisdom, if given without the right to be used, is\nnot to be welcomed! And wherein consists the use of wisdom? In being wise; that is its most\nvaluable attribute; if you withdraw this, wisdom becomes superfluous. If processes of torture are evil,\nthen being tortured is an evil ? with this reservation, indeed, that if you take away the\nconsequences, the former are not evil. Wisdom is a condition of \"mind perfected,\" and being wise is\nthe employment of this \"mind perfected.\" How can the employment of that thing not be a Good,\nwhich without employment is not a Good? If I ask you whether wisdom is to be desired, you admit\nthat it is. If I ask you whether the employment of wisdom is to be desired, you also admit the fact; for\nyou say that you will not receive wisdom if you are not allowed to employ it. Now that which is to be\ndesired is a Good. Being wise is the employment of wisdom, just as it is of eloquence to make a", "speech, or of the eyes to see things. Therefore, being wise is the employment of wisdom, and the\nemployment of wisdom is to be desired. Therefore being wise is a thing to be desired; and if it is a\nthing to be desired, it is a Good.", "Lo, these many years I have been condemning myself for imitating these men at the very time when\nI am arraigning them, and of wasting words on a subject that is perfectly clear. For who can doubt\nthat, if heat is an evil, it is also an evil to be hot? Or that, if cold is an evil, it is an evil to be cold? Or\nthat, if life is a Good, so is being alive? All such matters are on the outskirts of wisdom, not in\nwisdom itself. But our abiding-place should be in wisdom itself. Even though one takes a fancy to\nroam, wisdom has large and spacious retreats: we may investigate the nature of the gods, the fuel\nwhich feeds the constellations, or all the varied courses of the stars; we may speculate whether our\naffairs move in harmony with those of the stars, whether the impulse to motion comes from thence\ninto the minds and bodies of all, and whether even these events which we call fortuitous are fettered\nby strict laws and nothing in this universe is unforeseen or unregulated in its revolutions. Such topics\nhave nowadays been withdrawn from instruction in morals, but they uplift the mind and raise it to the\ndimensions of the subject which it discusses; the matters, however, of which I was speaking a while\nago, wear away and wear down the mind, not (as you and yours maintain) whetting, but weakening\nit. And I ask you, are we to fritter away that necessary study which we owe to greater and better\nthemes, in discussing a matter which may perhaps be wrong and is certainly of no avail? How will it\nprofit me to know whether wisdom is one thing, and being wise another? How will it profit me to\nknow that the one is, and the other is not, a Good? Suppose I take a chance, and gamble on this\nprayer: \"Wisdom for you, and being wise for me!\" We shall come out even.", "Try rather to show me the way by which I may attain those ends. Tell me what to avoid, what to\nseek, by what studies to strengthen my tottering mind, how I may rebuff the waves that strike me\nabeam and drive me from my course, by what means I may be able to cope with all my evils, and by\nwhat means I can be rid of the calamities that have plunged in upon me and those into which I\nmyself have plunged. Teach me how to bear the burden of sorrow without a groan on my part, and\nhow to bear prosperity without making others groan; also, how to avoid waiting for the ultimate and\ninevitable end, and to beat a retreat of my own free will, when it seems proper to me to do so. I think\nnothing is baser than to pray for death. For if you wish to live, why do you pray for death? And if you\ndo not wish to live, why do you ask the gods for that which they gave you at birth? For even as,\nagainst your will, it has been settled that you must die some day, so the time when you shall wish to\ndie is in your own hands. The one fact is to you a necessity, the other a privilege.", "I read lately a most disgraceful doctrine, uttered (more shame to him!) by a learned gentleman: \"So\nmay I die as soon as possible!\" Fool, thou art praying for something that is already thine own! \"So\nmay I die as soon as possible!\" Perhaps thou didst grow old while uttering these very words! At any\nrate, what is there to hinder? No one detains thee; escape by whatsoever way thou wilt! Select any\nportion of Nature, and bid it provide thee with a means of departure! These, namely, are the\nelements, by which the world's work is carried on ? water, earth, air. All these are no more the\ncauses of life than they are the ways of death. \"So may I die as soon as possible!\" And what is thy\nwish with regard to this \"as soon as possible\"? What day dost thou set for the event? It may be\nsooner than thy prayer requests. Words like this come from a weak mind, from one that courts pity\nby such cursing; he who prays for death does not wish to die. Ask the gods for life and health; if thou\nart resolved to die, death's reward is to have done with prayers.", "It is with such problems as these, my dear Lucilius, that we should deal, by such problems that we\nshould mould our minds. This is wisdom, this is what being wise means ? not to bandy empty\nsubtleties in idle and petty discussions. Fortune has set before you so many problems ? which you\nhave not yet solved ? and are you still splitting hairs? How foolish it is to practise strokes after you\nhave heard the signal for the fight! Away with all these dummy-weapons; you need armour for a fight\nto the finish. Tell me by what means sadness and fear may be kept from disturbing my soul, by what\nmeans I may shift off this burden of hidden cravings. Do something! \"Wisdom is a Good, but being\nwise is not a Good;\" such talk results for us in the judgment that we are not wise, and in making a\nlaughing-stock of this whole field of study ? on the ground that it wastes its effort on useless things.\nSuppose you knew that this question was also debated: whether future wisdom is a Good? For, I\nbeseech you, how could one doubt whether barns do not feel the weight of the harvest that is to\ncome, and that boyhood does not have premonitions of approaching young manhood by any brawn\nand power? The sick person, in the intervening period, is not helped by the health that is to come,\nany more than a runner or a wrestler is refreshed by the period of repose that will follow many\nmonths later. Who does not know that what is yet to be is not a Good, for the very reason that it is\nyet to be? For that which is good is necessarily helpful. And unless things are in the present, they\ncannot be helpful; and if a thing is not helpful, it is not a Good; if helpful, it is already. I shall be a\nwise man some day; and this Good will be mine when I shall be a wise man, but in the meantime it\nis non-existent. A thing must exist first, then may be of a certain kind. How, I ask you, can that which\nis still nothing be already a Good? And in what better way do you wish it to be proved to you that a\ncertain thing is not, than to say: \"It is yet to be\"? For it is clear that something which is on the way\nhas not yet arrived. \"Spring will follow\": I know that winter is here now. \"Summer will follow:\" I know\nthat it is not summer. The best proof to my mind that a thing is not yet present is that it is yet to be. I\nhope some day to be wise, but meanwhile I am not wise. For if I possessed that Good, I should now\nbe free from this Evil. Some day I shall be wise; from this very fact you may understand that I am not\nyet wise. I cannot at the same time live in that state of Good and in this state of Evil; the two ideas", "do not harmonize, nor do Evil and Good exist together in the same person.", "Let us rush past all this clever nonsense, and hurry on to that which will bring us real assistance. No\nman who is anxiously running after a midwife for his daughter in her birth-pangs will stop to read the\npraetor's edict or the order of events at the games. No one who is speeding to save his burning\nhouse will scan a checker-board to speculate how the imprisoned piece can be freed. But good\nheavens! ? in your case all sorts of news are announced on all sides ? your house afire, your\nchildren in danger, your country in a state of siege, your property plundered. Add to this shipwreck,\nearthquakes, and all other objects of dread; harassed amid these troubles, are you taking time for\nmatters which serve merely for mental entertainment? Do you ask what difference there is between\nwisdom and being wise? Do you tie and untie knots while such a ruin is hanging over your head?\nNature has not given us such a generous and free-handed space of time that we can have the\nleisure to waste any of it. Mark also how much is lost even when men are very careful: people are\nrobbed of one thing by ill-health and of another thing by illness in the family; at one time private, at\nanother public, business absorbs the attention; and all the while sleep shares our lives with us.", "Out of this time, so short and swift, that carries us away in its flight, of what avail is it to spend the\ngreater part on useless things? Besides, our minds are accustomed to entertain rather than to cure\nthemselves, to make an aesthetic pleasure out of philosophy, when philosophy should really be a\nremedy. What the distinction is between wisdom and being wise I do not know; but I do know that it\nmakes no difference to me whether I know such matters or am ignorant of them. Tell me: when I\nhave found out the difference between wisdom and being wise, shall I be wise?", "If thou hadst a step-mother and a mother at the same time, thou wouldst be dutiful to thy\nstep-mother, but still thou wouldst constantly return to thy mother. Let the court and philosophy now\nbe to thee step-mother and mother: return to philosophy frequently and repose in her, through whom\nwhat thou meetest with in the court appears to thee tolerable, and thou appearest tolerable in the\ncourt.", "Why then do you occupy me with the words rather than with the works of wisdom? Make me braver,\nmake me calmer, make me the equal of Fortune, make me her superior. And I can be her superior, if\nI apply to this end everything that I learn. Farewell.", "You have been demanding more frequent letters from me. But if we compare the accounts, you will\nnot be on the credit side. We had indeed made the agreement that your part came first, that you\nshould write the first letters, and that I should answer. However, I shall not be disagreeable; I know\nthat it is safe to trust you, so I shall pay in advance, and yet not do as the eloquent Cicero bids\nAtticus do: \"Even if you have nothing to say, write whatever enters your head.\" For there will always\nbe something for me to write about, even omitting all the kinds of news with which Cicero fills his\ncorrespondence: what candidate is in difficulties, who is striving on borrowed resources and who on\nhis own; who is a candidate for the consulship relying on Caesar, or on Pompey, or on his own\nstrong-box; what a merciless usurer is Caecilius, out of whom his friends cannot screw a penny for\nless than one per cent each month.", "But it is preferable to deal with one's own ills, rather than with another's ? to sift oneself and see for\nhow many vain things one is a candidate, and cast a vote for none of them. This, my dear Lucilius,\nis a noble thing, this brings peace and freedom ? to canvass for nothing, and to pass by all the\nelections of Fortune. How can you call it enjoyable, when the tribes are called together and the\ncandidates are making offerings in their favourite temples ? some of them promising money gifts\nand others doing business by means of an agent, or wearing down their hands with the kisses of\nthose to whom they will refuse the least finger-touch after being elected ? when all are excitedly\nawaiting the announcement of the herald, do you call it enjoyable, I say, to stand idle and look on at\nthis Vanity Fair without either buying or selling? How much greater joy does one feel who looks\nwithout concern, not merely upon the election of a praetor or of a consul, but upon that great\nstruggle in which some are seeking yearly honours, and others permanent power, and others the\ntriumph and the prosperous outcome of war, and others riches, or marriage and offspring, or the\nwelfare of themselves and their relatives! What a great-souled action it is to be the only person who\nis canvassing for nothing, offering prayers to no man, and saying: \"Fortune, I have nothing to do with\nyou. I am not at your service. I know that men like Cato are spurned by you, and men like Vatinius\nmade by you. I ask no favours.\" This is the way to reduce Fortune to the ranks.", "These, then, are the things about which we may write in turn, and this is the ever fresh material\nwhich we may dig out as we scan the restless multitudes of men, who, in order to attain something\nruinous, struggle on through evil to evil, and seek that which they must presently shun or even find\nsurfeiting. For who was ever satisfied, after attainment, with that which loomed up large as he\nprayed for it? Happiness is not, as men think, a greedy thing; it is a lowly thing; for that reason it\nnever gluts a man's desire. You deem lofty the objects you seek, because you are on a low level\nand hence far away from them; but they are mean in the sight of him who has reached them. And I\nam very much mistaken if he does not desire to climb still higher; that which you regard as the top is\nmerely a rung on the ladder. Now all men suffer from ignorance of the truth; deceived by common\nreport, they make for these ends as if they were good, and then, after having won their wish, and\nsuffered much, they find them evil, or empty, or less important than they had expected. Most men\nadmire that which deceives them at a distance, and by the crowd good things are supposed to be\nbig things.", "Now, lest this happen also in our own case, let us ask what is the Good. It has been explained in\nvarious ways; different men have described it in different ways. Some define it in this way. \"That\nwhich attracts and calls the spirit to itself is a Good.\" But the objection at once comes up ? what if it\ndoes attract, but straight to ruin? You know how seductive many evils are. That which is true differs\nfrom that which looks like the truth; hence the Good is connected with the true, for it is not good\nunless it is also true. But that which attracts and allures, is only like the truth; it steals your attention,\ndemands your interest, and draws you to itself. Therefore, some have given this definition: \"That is\ngood which inspires desire for itself, or rouses towards itself the impulse of a struggling soul.\" There\nis the same objection to this idea; for many things rouse the soul's impulses, and yet the search for\nthem is harmful to the seeker. The following definition is better: \"That is good which rouses the\nsoul's impulse towards itself in accordance with nature, and is worth seeking only when it begins to\nbe thoroughly worth seeking.\" It is by this time an honourable thing; for that is a thing completely\nworth seeking.", "The present topic suggests that I state the difference between the Good and the honourable. Now\nthey have a certain quality which blends with both and is inseparable from either: nothing can be\ngood unless it contains an element of the honourable, and the honourable is necessarily good.\nWhat, then, is the difference between these two qualities? The honourable is the perfect Good, and\nthe happy life is fulfilled thereby; through its influence other things also are rendered good. I mean\nsomething like this: there are certain things which are neither good nor bad ? as military or\ndiplomatic service, or the pronouncing of legal decisions. When such pursuits have been honourably\nconducted, they begin to be good, and they change over from the \"indifferent\" class into the Good.\nThe Good results from partnership with the honourable, but the honourable is good in itself. The\nGood springs from the honourable, but the latter from itself. What is good might have been bad;\nwhat is honourable could never have been anything but good.", "Some have defined as follows: \"That is good which is according to nature.\" Now attend to my own\nstatement: that which is good is according to nature, but that which is according to nature does not\nalso become immediately good; for many things harmonize with nature, but are so petty that it is not\nsuitable to call them good. For they are unimportant and deserve to be despised. But there is no\nsuch thing as a very small and despicable good, for, as long as it is scanty, it is not good, and when\nit begins to be good, it ceases to be scanty. How, then, can the Good be recognized? Only if it is\ncompletely according to nature.", "People say: \"You admit that that which is good is according to nature; for this is its peculiar quality.\nYou admit, too, that there are other things according to nature, which, however, are not good. How\nthen can the former be good, and the latter not? How can there be an alteration in the peculiar\nquality of a thing, when each has, in common with the other, the special attribute of being in accord\nwith nature?\" Surely because of its magnitude. It is no new idea that certain objects change as they\ngrow. A person, once a child, becomes a youth; his peculiar quality is transformed; for the child\ncould not reason, but the youth possesses reason. Certain things not only grow in size as they\ndevelop, but grow into something else. Some reply: \"But that which becomes greater does not\nnecessarily become different. It matters not at all whether you pour wine into a flask or into a vat; the\nwine keeps its peculiar quality in both vessels. Small and large quantities of honey are not distinct in\ntaste.\" But these are different cases which you mention; for wine and honey have a uniform quality;\nno matter how much the quantity is enlarged, the quality is the same. For some things endure\naccording to their kind and their peculiar qualities, even when they are enlarged.", "There are others, however, which, after many increments, are altered by the last addition; there is\nstamped upon them a new character, different from that of yore. One stone makes an archway ? the\nstone which wedges the leaning sides and holds the arch together by its position in the middle. And\nwhy does the last addition, although very slight, make a great deal of difference? Because it does\nnot increase; it fills up. Some things, through development, put off their former shape and are\naltered into a new figure. When the mind has for a long time developed some idea, and in the\nattempt to grasp its magnitude has become weary, that thing begins to be called \"infinite.\" And then\nthis has become something far different from what it was when it seemed great but finite. In the\nsame way we have thought of something as difficult to divide; at the very end, as the task grows\nmore and more hard, the thing is found to be \"indivisible.\" Similarly, from that which could scarcely\nor with difficulty be moved we have advanced on and on ? until we reach the \"immovable.\" By the\nsame reasoning a certain thing was according to nature; its greatness has altered it into some other\npeculiar quality and has rendered it a Good. Farewell.", "Whenever I have made a discovery, I do not wait for you to cry \"Shares!\" I say it to myself in your\nbehalf.

How keen you are to hear the\nnews! And rightly; I shall lead you by a short cut to the greatest riches. It will be necessary, however,\nfor you to find a loan; in order to be able to do business, you must contract a debt, although I do not\nwish you to arrange the loan through a middle-man, nor do I wish the brokers to be discussing your\nrating. I shall furnish you with a ready creditor, Cato's famous one, who says: \"Borrow from\nyourself!\" No matter how small it is, it will be enough if we can only make up the deficit from our own\nresources. For, my dear Lucilius, it does not matter whether you crave nothing, or whether you\npossess something. The important principle in either case is the same ? freedom from worry.", "When we have meat before us and such eatables we receive the impression, that this is the dead\nbody of a fish, and this is the dead body of a bird or of a pig; and again, that this Falernian is only a\nlittle grape juice, and this purple robe some sheep's wool dyed with the blood of a shell-fish: such\nthen are these impressions, and they reach the things themselves and penetrate them, and so we\nsee what kind of things they are. Just in the same way ought we to act all through life, and where\nthere are things which appear most worthy of our approbation, we ought to lay them bare and look\nat their worthlessness and strip them of all the words by which they are exalted. For outward show is\na wonderful perverter of the reason, and when thou art most sure that thou art employed about\nthings worth thy pains, it is then that it cheats thee most. Consider then what Crates says of\nXenocrates himself.", "But I do not counsel you to deny anything to nature ? for nature is insistent and cannot be\novercome; she demands her due ? but you should know that anything in excess of nature's wants is\na mere \"extra\" and is not necessary. If I am hungry, I must eat. Nature does not care whether the\nbread is the coarse kind or the finest wheat; she does not desire the stomach to be entertained, but\nto be filled. And if I am thirsty, Nature does not care whether I drink water from the nearest reservoir,\nor whether I freeze it artificially by sinking it in large quantities of snow. Nature orders only that the\nthirst be quenched; and it does not matter whether it be a golden, or crystal, or murrine goblet, or a\ncup from Tibur, or the hollow hand. Look to the end, in all matters, and then you will cast away\nsuperfluous things. Hunger calls me; let me stretch forth my hand to that which is nearest; my very\nhunger has made attractive in my eyes whatever I can grasp. A starving man despises nothing.", "Do you ask, then, what it is that has pleased me? It is this noble saying which I have discovered:\n\"The wise man is the keenest seeker for the riches of nature.\" \"What,\" you ask, \"will you present me\nwith an empty plate? What do you mean? I had already arranged my coffers; I was already looking\nabout to see some stretch of water on which I might embark for purposes of trade, some state\nrevenues that I might handle, and some merchandise that I might acquire. That is deceit ? showing\nme poverty after promising me riches.\" But, friend, do you regard a man as poor to whom nothing is\nwanting? \"It is, however,\" you reply, \"thanks to himself and his endurance, and not thanks to his\nfortune.\" Do you, then, hold that such a man is not rich, just because his wealth can never fail?\nWould you rather have much, or enough? He who has much desires more ? a proof that he has not\nyet acquired enough; but he who has enough has attained that which never fell to the rich man's lot\n? a stopping-point. Do you think that this condition to which I refer is not riches, just because no man\nhas ever been proscribed as a result of possessing them? Or because sons and wives have never\nthrust poison down one's throat for that reason? Or because in war-time these riches are\nunmolested? Or because they bring leisure in time of peace? Or because it is not dangerous to\npossess them, or troublesome to invest them?", "\"But one possesses too little, if one is merely free from cold and hunger and thirst.\" Jupiter himself\nhowever, is no better off. Enough is never too little, and not-enough is never too much. Alexander\nwas poor even after his conquest of Darius and the Indies. Am I wrong? He seeks something which\nhe can really make his own, exploring unknown seas, sending new fleets over the Ocean, and, so to\nspeak, breaking down the very bars of the universe. But that which is enough for nature, is not\nenough for man. There have been found persons who crave something more after obtaining\neverything; so blind are their wits and so readily does each man forget his start after he has got\nunder way. He who was but lately the disputed lord of an unknown corner of the world, is dejected\nwhen, after reaching the limits of the globe, he must march back through a world which he has made\nhis own. Money never made a man rich; on the contrary, it always smites men with a greater craving\nfor itself. Do you ask the reason for this? He who possesses more begins to be able to possess still\nmore.", "To sum up, you may hale forth for our inspection any of the millionaires whose names are told off\nwhen one speaks of Crassus and Licinus. Let him bring along his rating and his present property\nand his future expectations, and let him add them all together: such a man, according to my belief, is\npoor; according to yours, he may be poor some day. He, however, who has arranged his affairs\naccording to nature's demands, is free from the fear, as well as from the sensation, of poverty. And\nin order that you may know how hard it is to narrow one's interests down to the limits of nature ?\neven this very person of whom we speak, and whom you call poor, possesses something actually\nsuperfluous. Wealth, however, blinds and attracts the mob, when they see a large bulk of ready\nmoney brought out of a man's house, or even his walls crusted with abundance of gold, or a retinue\nthat is chosen for beauty of physique, or for attractiveness of attire. The prosperity of all these men\nlooks to public opinion; but the ideal man, whom we have snatched from the control of the people\nand of Fortune, is happy inwardly. For as far as those persons are concerned, in whose minds\nbustling poverty has wrongly stolen the title of riches ? these individuals have riches just as we say\nthat we \"have a fever,\" when really the fever has us. Conversely, we are accustomed to say: \"A\nfever grips him.\" And in the same way we should say: \"Riches grip him.\" There is therefore no\nadvice ? and of such advice no one can have too much ? which I would rather give you than this:\nthat you should measure all things by the demands of Nature; for these demands can be satisfied\neither without cost or else very cheaply. Only, do not mix any vices with these demands. Why need\nyou ask\nhow your food should be served, on what sort of table, with what sort of silver, with what\nwell-matched and smooth-faced young servants? Nature demands nothing except mere food.", "Dost seek, when thirst inflames thy throat, a cup of gold?", "Dost scorn all else but peacock's flesh or turbot\nWhen the hunger comes upon thee?", "Hunger is not ambitious; it is quite satisfied to come to an end; nor does it care very much what food\nbrings it to an end. Those things are but the instruments of a luxury which is not \"happiness\"; a\nluxury which seeks how it may prolong hunger even after repletion, how to stuff the stomach, not to\nfill it, and how to rouse a thirst that has been satisfied with the first drink. Horace's words are\ntherefore most excellent when he says that it makes no difference to one's thirst in what costly\ngoblet, or with what elaborate state, the water is served. For if you believe it to be of importance how\ncurly-haired your slave is, or how transparent is the cup which he offers you, you are not thirsty.", "Among other things, Nature has bestowed upon us this special boon: she relieves sheer necessity\nof squeamishness. The superfluous things admit of choice; we say: \"That is not suitable\"; \"this is not\nwell recommended\"; \"that hurts my eyesight.\" The Builder of the universe, who laid down for us the\nlaws of life, provided that we should exist in well-being, but not in luxury. Everything conducive to\nour well-being is prepared and ready to our hands; but what luxury requires can never be got\ntogether except with wretchedness and anxiety.", "Let us therefore use this boon of Nature by reckoning it among the things of high importance; let us\nreflect that Nature's best title to our gratitude is that whatever we want because of sheer necessity\nwe accept without squeamishness. Farewell.", "Your letter roamed over several little problems, but finally dwelt upon this alone, asking for\nexplanation: \"How do we acquire a knowledge of that which is good and that which is honourable?\"\nIn the opinion of other schools, these two qualities are distinct; among our followers, however, they\nare merely divided. This is what I mean: Some believe the Good to be that which is useful; they\naccordingly bestow this title upon riches, horses, wine, and shoes; so cheaply do they view the\nGood, and to such base uses do they let it descend. They regard as honourable that which agrees\nwith the principle of right conduct ? such as taking dutiful care of an old father, relieving a friend's\npoverty, showing bravery on a campaign, and uttering prudent and well-balanced opinions. We,\nhowever, do make the Good and the honourable two things, but we make them out of one: only the\nhonourable can be good; also, the honourable is necessarily good. I hold it superfluous to add the\ndistinction between these two qualities, inasmuch as I have mentioned it so many times. But I shall\nsay this one thing ? that we regard nothing as good which can be put to wrong use by any person.\nAnd you see for yourself to what wrong uses many men put their riches, their high position, or their\nphysical powers.", "Most of the things which the multitude admire are referred to objects of the most general kind, those\nwhich are held together by cohesion or natural organization, such as stones, wood, fig-trees, vines,\nolives. But those which are admired by men who are a little more reasonable are referred to the\nthings which are held together by a living principle, as flocks, herds. Those which are admired by\nmen who are still more instructed are the things which are held together by a rational soul, not\nhowever a universal soul, but rational so far as it is a soul skilled in some art, or expert in some\nother way, or simply rational so far as it possesses a number of slaves. But he who values rational\nsoul, a soul universal and fitted for political life, regards nothing else except this; and above all\nthings he keeps his soul in a condition and in an activity conformable to reason and social life, and\nhe co-operates to this end with those who are of the same kind as himself.", "To return to the matter on which you desire information: \"How we first acquire the knowledge of that\nwhich is good and that which is honourable.\" Nature could not teach us this directly; she has given\nus the seeds of knowledge, but not knowledge itself. Some say that we merely happened upon this\nknowledge; but it is unbelievable that a vision of virtue could have presented itself to anyone by\nmere chance. We believe that it is inference due to observation, a comparison of events that have\noccurred frequently; our school of philosophy hold that the honourable and the good have been\ncomprehended by analogy. Since the word \"analogy\" has been admitted to citizen rank by Latin\nscholars, I do not think that it ought to be condemned, but I do think it should be brought into the\ncitizenship which it can justly claim. I shall, therefore, make use of the word, not merely as admitted,\nbut as established.", "Now what this \"analogy\" is, I shall explain. We understood what bodily health was: and from this\nbasis we deduced the existence of a certain mental health also. We knew, too, bodily strength, and\nfrom this basis we inferred the existence of mental sturdiness. Kindly deeds, humane deeds, brave\ndeeds, had at times amazed us; so we began to admire them as if they were perfect. Underneath,\nhowever, there were many faults, hidden by the appearance and the brilliancy of certain\nconspicuous acts; to these we shut our eyes. Nature bids us amplify praiseworthy things: everyone\nexalts renown beyond the truth. And thus from such deeds we deduced the conception of some\ngreat good. Fabricius rejected King Pyrrhus's gold, deeming it greater than a king's crown to be able\nto scorn a king's money. Fabricius also, when the royal physician promised to give his master\npoison, warned Pyrrhus to beware of a plot. The selfsame man had the resolution to refuse either to\nbe won over by gold or to win by poison. So we admired the hero, who could not be moved by the\npromises of the king or against the king, who held fast to a noble ideal, and who ? is anything more\ndifficult? ? was in war sinless; for he believed that wrongs could be committed even against an\nenemy, and in that extreme poverty which he had made his glory, shrank from receiving riches as he\nshrank from using poison. \"Live,\" he cried, \"O Pyrrhus, thanks to me, and rejoice, instead of grieving\nas you have done till now, that Fabricius cannot be bribed!\"", "Horatius Cocles blocked the narrow bridge alone, and ordered his retreat to be cut off, that the\nenemy's path might be destroyed; then he long withstood his assailants until the crash of the beams,\nas they collapsed with a huge fall, rang in his ears. When he looked back and saw that his country,\nthrough his own danger, was free from danger, \"Whoever,\" he cried, \"wishes to pursue me this way,\nlet him come!\" He plunged headlong, taking as great care to come out armed from the midst of the\ndashing river-channel as he did to come out unhurt; he returned, preserving the glory of his\nconquering weapons, as safely as if he had come back over the bridge.", "These deeds and others of the same sort have revealed to us a picture of virtue. I will add\nsomething which may perhaps astonish you: evil things have sometimes offered the appearance of\nwhat is honourable, and that which is best has been manifested through, its opposite. For there are,\nas you know, vices which are next-door to virtues; and\neven that which is lost and debased can resemble that which is upright. So the spendthrift falsely\nimitates the liberal man ? although it matters a great deal whether a man knows how to give, or does\nnot know how to save, his money. I assure you, my dear Lucilius, there are many who do not give,\nbut simply throw away; and I do not call a man liberal who is out of temper with his money.\nCarelessness looks like ease, and rashness like bravery. This resemblance has forced us to watch\ncarefully and to distinguish between things which are by outward appearance closely connected, but\nwhich actually are very much at odds with one another; and in watching those who have become\ndistinguished as a result of some noble effort, we have been forced to observe what persons have\ndone some deed with noble spirit and lofty impulse, but have done it only once. We have marked\none man who is brave in war and cowardly in civil affairs, enduring poverty courageously and\ndisgrace shamefacedly; we have praised the deed but we have despised the man. Again, we have\nmarked another man who is kind to his friends and restrained towards his enemies, who carries on\nhis political and his personal business with scrupulous devotion, not lacking in longsuffering where\nthere is anything that must be endured, and not lacking in prudence when action is to be taken. We\nhave marked him giving with lavish hand when it was his duty to make a payment, and, when he\nhad to toil, striving resolutely and lightening his bodily weariness by his resolution. Besides, he has\nalways been the same, consistent in all his actions, not only sound in his judgment but trained by\nhabit to such an extent that he not only can act rightly, but cannot help acting rightly. We have\nformed the conception that in such a man perfect virtue exists.", "We have separated this perfect virtue into its several parts. The desires had to be reined in, fear to\nbe suppressed, proper actions to be arranged, debts to be paid; we therefore included self-restraint,\nbravery, prudence, and justice ? assigning to each quality its special function. How then have we\nformed the conception of virtue? Virtue has been manifested to us by this man's order, propriety,\nsteadfastness, absolute harmony of action, and a greatness of soul that rises superior to everything.\nThence has been derived our conception of the happy life, which flows along with steady course,\ncompletely under its own control. How then did we discover this fact? I will tell you: that perfect man,\nwho has attained virtue, never cursed his luck, and never received the results of chance with\ndejection; he believed that he was citizen and soldier of the universe, accepting his tasks as if they\nwere his orders. Whatever happened, he did not spurn it, as if it were evil and borne in upon him by\nhazard; he accepted it as if it were assigned to be his duty. \"Whatever this may be,\" he says, \"it is\nmy lot; it is rough and it is hard, but I must work diligently at the task.\"", "Necessarily, therefore, the man has shown himself great who has never grieved in evil days and\nnever bewailed his destiny; he has given a clear conception of himself to many men; he has shone\nforth like a light in the darkness and has turned towards himself the thoughts of all men, because he\nwas gentle and calm and equally compliant with the orders of man and of God. He possessed\nperfection of soul, developed to its highest capabilities, inferior only to the mind of God ? from whom\na part flows down even into this heart of a mortal. But this heart is never more divine than when it\nreflects upon its mortality, and understands that man was born for the purpose of fulfilling his life,\nand that the body is not a permanent dwelling, but a sort of inn (with a brief sojourn at that) which is\nto be left behind when one perceives that one is a burden to the host. The greatest proof, as I\nmaintain, my dear Lucilius, that the soul proceeds from loftier heights, is if it judges its present\nsituation lowly and narrow, and is not afraid to depart. For he who remembers whence he has come\nknows whither he is to depart. Do we not see how many discomforts drive us wild, and how\nill-assorted is our fellowship with the flesh? We complain at one time of our headaches, at another of\nour bad digestions, at another of our hearts and our throats. Sometimes the nerves trouble us,\nsometimes the feet; now it is diarrhoea, and again it is catarrh; we are at one time full-blooded, at\nanother anaemic; now this thing troubles us, now that, and bids us move away: it is just what\nhappens to those who dwell in the house of another.", "But we, to whom such corruptible bodies have been allotted, nevertheless set eternity before our\neyes, and in our hopes grasp at the utmost space of time to which the life of man can be extended,\nsatisfied with no income and with no influence. What can be more shameless or foolish than this?\nNothing is enough for us, though we must die some day, or rather, are already dying; for we stand\ndaily nearer the brink, and every hour of time thrusts us on towards the precipice over which we\nmust fall. See how blind our minds are! What I speak of as in the future is happening at this minute,\nand a large portion of it has already happened; for it consists of our past lives. But we are mistaken\nin fearing the last day, seeing that each day, as it passes, counts just as much to the credit of death.\nThe failing step does not produce, it merely announces, weariness. The last hour reaches, but every\nhour approaches, death. Death wears us away, but does not whirl us away.", "For this reason the noble soul, knowing its better nature, while taking care to conduct itself\nhonourably and seriously at the post of duty where it is placed, counts none of these extraneous\nobjects as its own, but uses them as if they were a loan, like a foreign visitor hastening on his way.\nWhen we see a person of such steadfastness, how can we help being conscious of the image of a\nnature so unusual? Particularly if, as I remarked, it was shown to be true greatness by its\nconsistency. It is indeed consistency that abides; false things do not last. Some men are like\nVatinius or like Cato by turns; at times they do not think even Curius stern enough, or Fabricius poor\nenough, or Tubero sufficiently frugal and contented with simple things; while at other times they vie\nwith Licinus in wealth, with Apicius in banqueting, or with Maecenas in daintiness. The greatest\nproof of an evil mind is unsteadiness, and continued wavering between pretence of virtue and love\nof vice.", "And sometimes ten.

Further, I owe it to\nthe gods that I was not hurried into any offence against any of them, though I had a disposition\nwhich, if opportunity had offered, might have led me to do something of this kind; but, through their\nfavour, there never was such a concurrence of circumstances as put me to the trial. Further, I am\nthankful to the gods that I was not longer brought up with my grandfather's concubine, and that I\npreserved the flower of my youth, and that I did not make proof of my virility before the proper\nseason, but even deferred the time; that I was subjected to a ruler and a father who was able to take\naway all pride from me, and to bring me to the knowledge that it is possible for a man to live in a\npalace without wanting either guards or embroidered dresses, or torches and statues, and such-like\nshow; but that it is in such a man's power to bring himself very near to the fashion of a private\nperson, without being for this reason either meaner in thought, or more remiss in action, with respect\nto the things which must be done for the public interest in a manner that befits a ruler. I thank the\ngods for giving me such a brother, who was able by his moral character to rouse me to vigilance\nover myself, and who, at the same time, pleased me by his respect and affection; that my children\nhave not been stupid nor deformed in body; that I did not make more proficiency in rhetoric, poetry,\nand the other studies, in which I should perhaps have been completely engaged, if I had seen that I\nwas making progress in them; that I made haste to place those who brought me up in the station of\nhonour, which they seemed to desire, without putting them off with hope of my doing it some time\nafter, because they were then still young; that I knew Apollonius, Rusticus, Maximus; that I received\nclear and frequent impressions about living according to nature, and what kind of a life that is, so\nthat, so far as depended on the gods, and their gifts, and help, and inspirations, nothing hindered\nme from forthwith living according to nature, though I still fall short of it through my own fault, and\nthrough not observing the admonitions of the gods, and, I may almost say, their direct instructions;\nthat my body has held out so long in such a kind of life; that I never touched either Benedicta or\nTheodotus, and that, after having fallen into amatory passions, I was cured; and, though I was often", "out of humour with Rusticus, I never did anything of which I had occasion to repent; that, though it\nwas my mother's fate to die young, she spent the last years of her life with me; that, whenever I\nwished to help any man in his need, or on any other occasion, I was never told that I had not the\nmeans of doing it; and that to myself the same necessity never happened, to receive anything from\nanother; that I have such a wife, so obedient, and so affectionate, and so simple; that I had\nabundance of good masters for my children; and that remedies have been shown to me by dreams,\nboth others, and against bloodspitting and giddiness...; and that, when I had an inclination to\nphilosophy, I did not fall into the hands of any sophist, and that I did not waste my time on writers of\nhistories, or in the resolution of syllogisms, or occupy myself about the investigation of appearances\nin the heavens; for all these things require the help of the gods and fortune.", "Some things are hurrying into existence, and others are hurrying out of it; and of that which is\ncoming into existence part is already extinguished. Motions and changes are continually renewing\nthe world, just as the uninterrupted course of time is always renewing the infinite duration of ages. In\nthis flowing stream then, on which there is no abiding, what is there of the things which hurry by on\nwhich a man would set a high price? It would be just as if a man should fall in love with one of the\nsparrows which fly by, but it has already passed out of sight. Something of this kind is the very life of\nevery man, like the exhalation of the blood and the respiration of the air. For such as it is to have\nonce drawn in the air and to have given it back, which we do every moment, just the same is it with\nthe whole respiratory power, which thou didst receive at thy birth yesterday and the day before, to\ngive it back to the element from which thou didst first draw it.", "The men I speak of are of this stamp; they are like the man whom Horatius Flaccus describes ? a\nman never the same, never even like himself; to such an extent does he wander off into opposites.\nDid I say many are so? It is the case with almost all. Everyone changes his plans and prayers day\nby day. Now he would have a wife, and now a mistress; now he would be king, and again he strives\nto conduct himself so that no slave is more cringing; now he puffs himself up until he becomes\nunpopular; again, he shrinks and contracts into greater humility than those who are really\nunassuming; at one time he scatters money, at another he steals it. That is how a foolish mind is\nmost clearly demonstrated: it shows first in this shape and then in that, and is never like itself ?\nwhich is, in my opinion, the most shameful of qualities. Believe me, it is a great r\u00f4le ? to play the r\u00f4le\nof one man. But nobody can be one person except the wise man; the rest of us often shift our\nmasks. At times you will think us thrifty and serious, at other times wasteful and idle. We continually\nchange our characters and play a part contrary to that which we have discarded. You should\ntherefore force yourself to maintain to the very end of life's drama the character which you assumed\nat the beginning. See to it that men be able to praise you; if not, let them at least identify you.\nIndeed, with regard to the man whom you saw but yesterday, the question may properly be asked:\n\"Who is he?\" So great a change has there been! Farewell.", "You will bring suit against me, I feel sure, when I set forth for you to-day's little problem, with which\nwe have already fumbled long enough. You will cry out again: \"What has this to do with character?\"\nCry out if you like, but let me first of all match you with other opponents, against whom you may\nbring suit ? such as Posidonius and Archidemus; these men will stand trial. I shall then go on to say\nthat whatever deals with character does not necessarily produce good character. Man needs one\nthing for his food, another for his exercise, another for his clothing, another for his instruction, and\nanother for his pleasure. Everything, however, has reference to man's needs, although everything\ndoes not make him better. Character is affected by different things in different ways: some things\nserve to correct and regulate character, and others investigate its nature and origin. And when I\nseek the reason why Nature brought forth man, and why she set him above other animals, do you\nsuppose that I have left character-study in the rear? No; that is wrong. For how are you to know\nwhat character is desirable, unless you have discovered what is best suited to man? Or unless you\nhave studied his nature? You can find out what you should do and what you should avoid, only\nwhen you have learned what you owe to your own nature.", "\"I desire,\" you say, \"to learn how I may crave less, and fear less. Rid me of my unreasoning beliefs.\nProve to me that so-called felicity is fickle and empty, and that the word easily admits of a syllable's\nincrease.\" I shall fulfil your want, encouraging your virtues and lashing your vices. People may\ndecide that I am too zealous and reckless in this particular; but I shall never cease to hound\nwickedness, to check the most unbridled emotions, to soften the force of pleasures which will result\nin pain, and to cry down men's prayers. Of course I shall do this; for it is the greatest evils that we\nhave prayed for, and from that which has made us give thanks comes all that demands consolation.", "Meanwhile, allow me to discuss thoroughly some points which may seem now to be rather remote\nfrom the present inquiry. We were once debating whether all animals had any feelings about their\n\"constitution.\" That this is the case is proved particularly by their making motions of such fitness and\nnimbleness that they seem to be trained for the purpose. Every being is clever in its own line. The\nskilled workman handles his tools with an ease born of experience; the pilot knows how to steer his\nship skilfully; the artist can quickly lay on the colours which he has prepared in great variety for the\npurpose of rendering the likeness, and passes with ready eye and hand from palette to canvas. In\nthe same way an animal is agile in all that pertains to the use of its body. We are apt to wonder at\nskilled dancers because their gestures are perfectly adapted to the meaning of the piece and its\naccompanying emotions, and their movements match the speed of the dialogue. But that which art\ngives to the craftsman, is given to the animal by nature. No animal handles its limbs with difficulty,\nno animal is at a loss how to use its body. This function they exercise immediately at birth. They\ncome into the world with this knowledge; they are born full-trained.", "But people reply: \"The reason why animals are so dexterous in the use of their limbs is that if they\nmove them unnaturally, they will feel pain. They are compelled to do thus, according to your school,\nand it is fear rather than will-power which moves them in the right direction.\" This idea is wrong.\nBodies driven by a compelling force move slowly; but those which move of their own accord possess\nalertness. The proof that it is not fear of pain which prompts them thus, is, that even when pain\nchecks them they struggle to carry out their natural motions. Thus the child who is trying to stand\nand is becoming used to carry his own weight, on beginning to test his strength, falls and rises again\nand again with tears until through painful effort he has trained himself to the demands of nature. And\ncertain animals with hard shells, when turned on their backs, twist and grope with their feet and\nmake motions side-ways until they are restored to their proper position. The tortoise on his back\nfeels no suffering; but he is restless because he misses his natural condition, and does not cease to\nshake himself about until he stands once more upon his feet.", "So all these animals have a consciousness of their physical constitution, and for that reason can\nmanage their limbs as readily as they do; nor have we any better proof that they come into being\nequipped with this knowledge than the fact that no animal is unskilled in the use of its body. But\nsome object as follows: \"According to your account, one's constitution consists of a ruling power in\nthe soul which has a certain relation towards the body. But how can a child comprehend this\nintricate and subtle principle, which I can scarcely explain even to you? All living creatures should be\nborn logicians, so as to understand a definition which is obscure to the majority of Roman citizens!\"\nYour objection would be true if I spoke of living creatures as understanding \"a definition of\nconstitution,\" and not \"their actual constitution.\" Nature is easier to understand than to explain;\nhence, the child of whom we were speaking does not understand what \"constitution\" is, but\nunderstands its own constitution. He does not know what \"a living creature\" is, but he feels that he is\nan animal. Moreover, that very constitution of his own he only understands confusedly, cursorily,\nand darkly. We also know that we possess souls, but we do not know the essence, the place, the\nquality, or the source, of the soul. Such as is the consciousness of our souls which we possess,\nignorant as we are of their nature and position, even so all animals possess a consciousness of their\nown constitutions. For they must necessarily feel this, because it is the same agency by which they\nfeel other things also; they must necessarily have a feeling of the principle which they obey and by\nwhich they are controlled. Everyone of us understands that there is something which stirs his\nimpulses, but he does not know what it is. He knows that he has a sense of striving, although he\ndoes not know what it is or its source. Thus even children and animals have a consciousness of\ntheir primary element, but it is not very clearly outlined or portrayed.", "\"You maintain, do you,\" says the objector, \"that every living thing is at the start adapted to its\nconstitution, but that man's constitution is a reasoning one, and hence man is adapted to himself not\nmerely as a living, but as a reasoning, being? For man is dear to himself in respect of that wherein\nhe is a man. How, then, can a child, being not yet gifted with reason, adapt himself to a reasoning\nconstitution?\" But each age has its own constitution, different in the case of the child, the boy, and\nthe old man; they are all adapted to the constitution wherein they find themselves. The child is\ntoothless, and he is fitted to this condition. Then his teeth grow, and he is fitted to that condition\nalso. Vegetation also, which will develop into grain and fruits, has a special constitution when young\nand scarcely peeping over the tops of the furrows, another when it is strengthened and stands upon\na stalk which is soft but strong enough to bear its weight, and still another when the colour changes\nto yellow, prophesies threshing-time, and hardens in the ear ? no matter what may be the\nconstitution into which the plant comes, it keeps it, and conforms thereto. The periods of infancy,\nboyhood, youth, and old age, are different; but I, who have been infant, boy, and youth, am still the\nsame. Thus, although each has at different times a different constitution, the adaptation of each to\nits constitution is the same. For nature does not consign boyhood or youth, or old age, to me; it\nconsigns me to them. Therefore, the child is adapted to that constitution which is his at the present\nmoment of childhood, not to that which will be his in youth. For even if there is in store for him any\nhigher phase into which he must be changed, the state in which he is born is also according to\nnature. First of all, the living being is adapted to itself, for there must be a pattern to which all other\nthings may be referred. I seek pleasure; for whom? For myself. I am therefore looking out for myself.\nI shrink from pain; on behalf of whom? Myself. Therefore, I am looking out for myself. Since I gauge\nall my actions with reference to my own welfare, I am looking out for myself before all else. This\nquality exists in all living beings ? not engrafted but inborn.", "Nature brings up her own offspring and does not cast them away; and because the most assured\nsecurity is that which is nearest, every man has been entrusted to his own self. Therefore, as I have\nremarked in the course of my previous correspondence, even young animals, on issuing from the\nmother's womb or from the egg, know at once of their own accord what is harmful for them, and\navoid death-dealing things. They even shrink when they notice the shadow of birds of prey which flit\noverhead.", "No animal, when it enters upon life, is free from the fear of death. People may ask: \"How can an\nanimal at birth have an understanding of things wholesome or destructive?\" The first question,\nhowever, is whether it can have such understanding, and not how it can understand. And it is clear\nthat they have such understanding from the fact that, even if you add understanding, they will act no\nmore adequately than they did in the first place. Why should the hen show no fear of the peacock or\nthe goose, and yet run from the hawk, which is a so much smaller animal not even familiar to the\nhen? Why should young chickens fear a cat and not a dog? These fowls clearly have a\npresentiment of harm ? one not based on actual experiments; for they avoid a thing before they can\npossibly have experience of it. Furthermore, in order that you may not suppose this to be the result\nof chance, they do not shrink from certain other things which you would expect them to fear, nor do\nthey ever forget vigilance and care in this regard; they all possess equally the faculty of avoiding\nwhat is destructive. Besides, their fear does not grow as their lives lengthen.", "Hence indeed it is evident that these animals have not reached such a condition through\nexperience; it is because of an inborn desire for self-preservation. The teachings of experience are\nslow and irregular; but whatever Nature communicates belongs equally to everyone, and comes\nimmediately. If, however, you require an explanation, shall I tell you how it is that every living thing\ntries to understand that which is harmful? It feels that it is constructed of flesh; and so it perceives to\nwhat an extent flesh may be cut or burned or crushed, and what animals are equipped with the\npower of doing this damage; it is of animals of this sort that it derives an unfavourable and hostile\nidea. These tendencies are closely connected; for each animal at the same time consults its own\nsafety, seeking that which helps it, and shrinks from that which will harm it. Impulses towards useful\nobjects, and revulsion from the opposite, are according to nature; without any reflection to prompt\nthe idea, and without any advice, whatever Nature has prescribed, is done.", "Neither is transpiration, as in plants, a thing to be valued, nor respiration, as in domesticated\nanimals and wild beasts, nor the receiving of impressions by the appearances of things, nor being\nmoved by desires as puppets by strings, nor assembling in herds, nor being nourished by food; for\nthis is just like the act of separating and parting with the useless part of our food. What then is worth\nbeing valued? To be received with clapping of hands? No. Neither must we value the clapping of\ntongues, for the praise which comes from the many is a clapping of tongues. Suppose then that thou\nhast given up this worthless thing called fame, what remains that is worth valuing? This in my\nopinion, to move thyself and to restrain thyself in conformity to thy proper constitution, to which end\nboth all employments and arts lead. For every art aims at this, that the thing which has been made\nshould be adapted to the work for which it has been made; and both the vine-planter who looks after\nthe vine, and the horse-breaker, and he who trains the dog, seek this end. But the education and the\nteaching of youth aim at something. In this then is the value of the education and the teaching. And\nif this is well, thou wilt not seek anything else. Wilt thou not cease to value many other things too?\nThen thou wilt be neither free, nor sufficient for thy own happiness, nor without passion. For of\nnecessity thou must be envious, jealous, and suspicious of those who can take away those things,\nand plot against those who have that which is valued by thee. Of necessity a man must be\naltogether in a state of perturbation who wants any of these things; and besides, he must often find\nfault with the gods. But to reverence and honour thy own mind will make thee content with thyself,\nand in harmony with society, and in agreement with the gods, that is, praising all that they give and\nhave ordered.", "Do you not see how skillful bees are in building their cells? How completely harmonious in sharing\nand enduring toil? Do you not see how the spider weaves a web so subtle that man's hand cannot\nimitate it; and what a task it is to arrange the threads, some directed straight towards the centre, for\nthe sake of making the web solid, and others running in circles and lessening in thickness ? for the\npurpose of tangling and catching in a sort of net the smaller insects for whose ruin the spider\nspreads the web? This art is born, not taught; and for this reason no animal is more skilled than any\nother. You will notice that all spider-webs are equally fine, and that the openings in all honeycomb\ncells are identical in shape. Whatever art communicates is uncertain and uneven; but Nature's\nassignments are always uniform. Nature has communicated nothing except the duty of taking care\nof themselves and the skill to do so; that is why living and learning begin at the same time. No\nwonder that living things are born with a gift whose absence would make birth useless. This is the\nfirst equipment that Nature granted them for the maintenance of their existence ? the quality of\nadaptability and self-love. They could not survive except by desiring to do so. Nor would this desire\nalone have made them prosper, but without it nothing could have prospered. In no animal can you\nobserve any low esteem, or even any carelessness, of self. Dumb beasts, sluggish in other\nrespects, are clever at living. So you will see that creatures which are useless to others are alert for\ntheir own preservation. Farewell.", "The day has already begun to lessen. It has shrunk considerably, but yet will still allow a goodly\nspace of time if one rises, so to speak, with the day itself.

They are as weird as the birds of\nnight. Although they pass their hours of darkness amid wine and perfumes, although they spend the\nwhole extent of their unnatural waking hours in eating dinners ? and those too cooked separately to\nmake up many courses ? they are not really banqueting; they are conducting their own funeral\nservices. And the dead at least have their banquets by daylight.", "But indeed to one who is active no day is long. So let us lengthen our lives; for the duty and the\nproof of life consist in action. Cut short the night; use some of it for the day's business. Birds that are\nbeing prepared for the banquet, that they may be easily fattened through lack of exercise, are kept\nin darkness; and similarly, if men vegetate without physical activity, their idle bodies are\noverwhelmed with flesh, and in their self-satisfied retirement the fat of indolence grows upon them.\nMoreover, the bodies of those who have sworn allegiance to the hours of\ndarkness have a loathsome appearance. Their complexions are more alarming than those of\nanaemic invalids; they are lackadaisical and flabby with dropsy; though still alive, they are already\ncarrion.

It is the motto of luxury to enjoy what is unusual, and not only to depart from that\nwhich is right, but to leave it as far behind as possible, and finally even take a stand in opposition\nthereto. Do you not believe that men live contrary to Nature who drink fasting, who take wine into\nempty veins, and pass to their food in a state of intoxication? And yet this is one of youth's popular\nvices ? to perfect their strength in order to drink on the very threshold of the bath, amid the unclad\nbathers; nay even to soak in wine and then immediately to rub off the sweat which they have\npromoted by many a hot glass of liquor! To them, a glass after lunch or one after dinner is\nbourgeois; it is what the country squires do, who are not connoisseurs in pleasure. This unmixed\nwine delights them just because there is no food to float in it, because it readily makes its way into\ntheir muscles; this boozing pleases them just because the stomach is empty.", "Do you not believe that men live contrary to Nature who exchange the fashion of their attire with\nwomen?

We should not do as mankind do. It is low and mean to live in the usual and\nconventional way. Let us abandon the ordinary sort of day. Let us have a morning that is a special\nfeature of ours, peculiar to ourselves!\" Such men are, in my opinion, as good as dead. Are they not\nall but present at a funeral ? and before their time too ? when they live amid torches and tapers? I\nremember that this sort of life was very fashionable at one time: among such men as Acilius Buta, a\nperson of praetorian rank, who ran through a tremendous estate and on confessing his bankruptcy\nto Tiberius, received the answer: \"You have waked up too late!\" Julius Montanus was once reading\na poem aloud; he was a middling good poet, noted for his friendship with Tiberius, as well as his fall\nfrom favour. He always used to fill his poems with a generous sprinkling of sunrises and sunsets.\nHence, when a certain person was complaining that Montanus had read all day long, and declared\nthat no man should attend any of his readings, Natta Pinarius remarked: \"I couldn't make a fairer\nbargain than this: I am ready to listen to him from sunrise to sunset!\"\nMontanus was reading, and had reached the words:", "'Gins the bright morning to spread forth his flames clear-burning; the red dawn", "Above, below, all around are the movements of the elements. But the motion of virtue is in none of\nthese: it is something more divine, and advancing by a way hardly observed it goes happily on its\nroad.", "Scatters its light; and the sad-eyed swallow returns to her nestlings,\nBringing the chatterers' food, and with sweet bill sharing and serving.", "Then Varus, a Roman knight, the hanger-on of Marcus Vinicius, and a sponger at elegant dinners\nwhich he earned by his degenerate wit, shouted: \"Bed-time for Buta!\" And later, when Montanus\ndeclaimed\nLo, now the shepherds have folded their flocks, and the slow-moving darkness", "'Gins to spread silence o'er lands that are drowsily lulled into slumber,", "this same Varus remarked: \"What? Night already? I'll go and pay my morning call on Buta!\" You\nsee, nothing was more notorious than Buta's upside-down manner of life. But this life, as I said, was\nfashionable at one time. And the reason why some men live thus is not because they think that night\nin itself offers any greater attractions, but because that which is normal gives them no particular\npleasure; light being a bitter enemy of the evil conscience, and, when one craves or scorns all things\nin proportion as they have cost one much or little, illumination for which one does not pay is an\nobject of contempt. Moreover, the luxurious person wishes to be an object of gossip his whole life; if\npeople are silent about him, he thinks that he is wasting his time. Hence he is uncomfortable\nwhenever any of his actions escape notoriety.", "Many men eat up their property, and many men keep mistresses. If you would win a reputation\namong such persons, you must make your programme not only one of luxury but one of notoriety;\nfor in such a busy community wickedness does not discover the ordinary sort of scandal.

Papinius belonged to the tribe of those who shun the light. \"About nine o'clock at\nnight I hear the sound of whips. I ask what is going on, and they tell me that Papinius is going over\nhis accounts. About twelve there is a strenuous shouting; I ask what the matter is, and they say he\nis exercising his voice. About two a.m. I ask the significance of the sound of wheels; they tell me that\nhe is off for a drive. And at dawn there is a tremendous flurry-calling of slaves and butlers, and\npandemonium among the cooks. I ask the meaning of this also, and they tell me that he has called\nfor his cordial and his appetizer, after leaving the bath. His dinner,\" said Pedo, \"never went beyond\nthe day, for he lived very sparingly; he was lavish with nothing but the night. Accordingly, if you\nbelieve those who call him tight-fisted and mean, you will call him also a 'slave of the lamp.'\"", "You should not be surprised at finding so many special manifestations of the vices; for vices vary,\nand there are countless phases of them, nor can all their various kinds be classified. The method of\nmaintaining righteousness is simple; the method of maintaining wickedness is complicated, and has\ninfinite opportunity to swerve. And the same holds true of character; if you follow nature, character is\neasy to manage, free, and with very slight shades of difference; but the sort of person I have\nmentioned possesses badly warped character, out of harmony with all things, including himself. The\nchief cause, however, of this disease seems to me to be a squeamish revolt from the normal\nexistence. Just as such persons mark themselves off from others in their dress, or in the elaborate\narrangement of their dinners, or in the elegance of their carriages; even so they desire to make\nthemselves peculiar by their way of dividing up the hours of their day. They are unwilling to be\nwicked in the conventional way, because notoriety is the reward of their sort of wickedness.\nNotoriety is what all such men seek ? men who are, so to speak, living backwards.", "For this reason, Lucilius, let us keep to the way which Nature has mapped out for us, and let us not\nswerve therefrom. If we follow Nature, all is easy and unobstructed; but if we combat Nature, our life\ndiffers not a whit from that of men who row against the current. Farewell.", "Wearied with the discomfort rather than with the length of my journey, I have reached my Alban villa\nlate at night, and I find nothing in readiness except myself. So I am getting rid of fatigue at my\nwriting-table: I derive some good from this tardiness on the part of my cook and my baker. For I am\ncommuning with myself on this very topic ? that nothing is heavy if one accepts it with a light heart,\nand that nothing need provoke one's anger if one does not add to one's pile of troubles by getting\nangry. My baker is out of bread; but the overseer, or the house-steward, or one of my tenants can\nsupply me therewith. \"Bad bread!\" you say. But just wait for it; it will become good. Hunger will make\neven such bread delicate and of the finest flavour. For that reason I must not eat until hunger bids\nme; so I shall wait and shall not eat until I can either get good bread or else cease to be squeamish\nabout it. It is necessary that one grow accustomed to slender fare: because there are many\nproblems of time and place which will cross the path even of the rich man and one equipped for\npleasure, and bring him up with a round turn. To have whatsoever he wishes is in no man's power; it\nis in his power not to wish for what he has not, but cheerfully to employ what comes to him. A great\nstep towards independence is a good-humoured stomach, one that is willing to endure rough\ntreatment.", "You cannot imagine how much pleasure I derive from the fact that my weariness is becoming\nreconciled to itself; I am asking for no slaves to rub me down, no bath, and no other restorative\nexcept time. For that which toil has accumulated, rest can lighten. This repast, whatever it may be,\nwill give me more pleasure than an inaugural banquet. For I have made trial of my spirit on a sudden\n? a simpler and a truer test. Indeed, when a man has made preparations and given himself a formal\nsummons to be patient, it is not equally clear just how much real strength of mind he possesses; the\nsurest proofs are those which one exhibits off-hand, viewing one's own troubles not only fairly but\ncalmly, not flying into fits of temper or wordy wranglings, supplying one's own needs by not craving\nsomething which was really due, and reflecting that our habits may be unsatisfied, but never our\nown real selves. How many things are superfluous we fail to realize until they begin to be wanting;\nwe merely used them not because we needed them but because we had them. And how much do\nwe acquire simply because our neighbours have acquired such things, or because most men\npossess them! Many of our troubles may be explained from the fact that we live according to a\npattern, and, instead of arranging our lives according to reason, are led astray by convention.", "There are things which, if done by the few, we should refuse to imitate; yet when the majority have\nbegun to do them, we follow along ? just as if anything were more honourable because it is more\nfrequent! Furthermore, wrong views, when they have become prevalent, reach, in our eyes, the\nstandard of righteousness. Everyone now travels with Numidian outriders preceding him, with a\ntroop of slave-runners to clear the way; we deem it disgraceful to have no attendants who will elbow\ncrowds from the road, or will prove, by a great cloud of dust, that a high dignitary is approaching!\nEveryone now possesses mules that are laden with crystal and myrrhine cups carved by skilled\nartists of great renown; it is disgraceful for all your baggage to be made up of that which can be\nrattled along without danger. Everyone has pages who ride along with ointment-covered faces, so\nthat the heat or the cold will not harm their tender complexions; it is disgraceful that none of your\nattendant slave-boys should show a healthy cheek, not covered with cosmetics.", "How strangely men act. They will not praise those who are living at the same time and living with\nthemselves; but to be themselves praised by posterity, by those whom they have never seen or ever\nwill see, this they set much value on. But this is very much the same as if thou shouldst be grieved\nbecause those who have lived before thee did not praise thee.", "You should avoid conversation with all such persons: they are the sort that communicate and\nengraft their bad habits from one to another. We used to think that the very worst variety of these\nmen were those who vaunted their words; but there are certain men who vaunt their wickedness.\nTheir talk is very harmful; for even though it is not at once convincing, yet they leave the seeds of\ntrouble in the soul, and the evil which is sure to spring into new strength follows us about even when\nwe have parted from them. Just as those who have attended a concert carry about in their heads\nthe melodies and the charm of the songs they have heard ? a proceeding which interferes with their\nthinking and does not allow them to concentrate upon serious subjects, ? even so the speech of\nflatterers and enthusiasts over that which is depraved sticks in our minds long after we have heard\nthem talk. It is not easy to rid the memory of a catching tune; it stays with us, lasts on, and comes\nback from time to time. Accordingly, you should close your ears against evil talk, and right at the\noutset, too; for when such talk has gained an entrance and the words are admitted and are in our\nminds, they become more shameless. And then we begin to speak as follows: \"Virtue, Philosophy,\nJustice ? this is a jargon of empty words. The only way to be happy is to do yourself well. To eat,\ndrink, and spend your money is the only real life, the only way to remind yourself that you are mortal.\nOur days flow on, and life ? which we cannot restore ? hastens away from us. Why hesitate to come\nto our senses? This life of ours will not always admit pleasures; meantime, while it can do so, while it\nclamours for them, what profit lies in imposing thereupon frugality? Therefore get ahead of death,\nand let anything that death will filch from you be squandered now upon yourself. You have no\nmistress, no favourite slave to make your mistress envious; you are sober when you make your daily\nappearance in public; you dine as if you had to show your account-book to 'Papa'; but that is not\nliving, it is merely going shares in someone else's existence. And what madness it is to be looking\nout for the interests of your heir, and to deny yourself everything, with the result that you turn friends\ninto enemies by the vast amount of the fortune you intend to leave! For the more the heir is to get\nfrom you, the more he will rejoice in your taking-off! All those sour fellows who criticize other men's\nlives in a spirit of priggishness and are real enemies to their own lives, playing schoolmaster to the", "world ? you should not consider them as worth a farthing, nor should you hesitate to prefer good\nliving to a good reputation.\"", "These are voices which you ought to shun just as Ulysses did; he would not sail past them until he\nwas lashed to the mast. They are no less potent; they lure men from country, parents, friends, and\nvirtuous ways; and by a hope that, if not base, is ill-starred, they wreck them upon a life of\nbaseness. How much better to follow a straight course and attain a goal where the words \"pleasant\"\nand \"honourable\" have the same meaning! This end will be possible for us if we understand that\nthere are two classes of objects which either attract us or repel us. We are attracted by such things\nas riches, pleasures, beauty, ambition, and other such coaxing and pleasing objects; we are\nrepelled by toil, death, pain, disgrace, or lives of greater frugality. We ought therefore to train\nourselves so that we may avoid a fear of the one or a desire for the other. Let us fight in the\nopposite fashion: let us retreat from the objects that allure, and rouse ourselves to meet the objects\nthat attack.", "Do you not see how different is the method of descending a mountain from that employed in\nclimbing upwards? Men coming down a slope bend backwards; men ascending a steep place lean\nforward. For, my dear Lucilius, to allow yourself to put your body's weight ahead when coming down,\nor, when climbing up, to throw it backward is to comply with vice. The pleasures take one down hill\nbut one must work upwards toward that which is rough and hard to climb; in the one case let us\nthrow our bodies forward, in the others let us put the check-rein on them.", "Do you believe me to be stating now that only those men bring ruin to our ears, who praise\npleasure, who inspire us with fear of pain ? that element which is in itself provocative of fear? I\nbelieve that we are also in injured by those who masquerade under the disguise of the Stoic school\nand at the same time urge us on into vice. They boast that only the wise man and the learned is a\nlover. \"He alone has wisdom in this art; the wise man too is best skilled in drinking and feasting. Our\nstudy ought to be this alone: up to what age the bloom of love can endure!\" All this may be regarded\nas a concession to the ways of Greece; we ourselves should preferably turn our attention to words\nlike these: \"No man is good by chance. Virtue is something which must be learned. Pleasure is low,\npetty, to be deemed worthless, shared even by dumb animals ? the tiniest and meanest of whom fly\ntowards pleasure. Glory is an empty and fleeting thing, lighter than air. Poverty is an evil to no man\nunless he kick against the goads. Death is not an evil; why need you ask? Death alone is the equal\nprivilege of mankind. Superstition is the misguided idea of a lunatic; it fears those whom it ought to\nlove; it is an outrage upon those whom it worships. For what difference is there between denying the\ngods and dishonouring them?\"", "You should learn such principles as these, nay rather you should learn them by heart; philosophy\nought not to try to explain away vice. For a sick man, when his physician bids him live recklessly, is\ndoomed beyond recall. Farewell.", "Didst thou not shrink, and feel it shame to learn\nSuch lowly duties.", "But you do not shrink, nor are you deterred by any subtleties of study. For your cultivated mind is\nnot wont to investigate such important subjects in a free-and-easy manner. I approve your method in\nthat you make everything count towards a certain degree of progress, and in that you are\ndisgruntled only when nothing can be accomplished by the greatest degree of subtlety. And I shall\ntake pains to show that this is the case now also. Our question is, whether the Good is grasped by\nthe senses or by the understanding; and the corollary thereto is that it does not exist in dumb\nanimals or little children.", "Those who rate pleasure as the supreme ideal hold that the Good is a matter of the senses; but we\nStoics maintain that it is a matter of the understanding, and we assign it to the mind. If the senses\nwere to pass judgment on what is good, we should never reject any pleasure; for there is no\npleasure that does not attract, no pleasure that does not please. Conversely, we should undergo no\npain voluntarily; for there is no pain that does not clash with the senses. Besides, those who are too\nfond of pleasure and those who fear pain to the greatest degree would in that case not deserve\nreproof. But we condemn men who are slaves to their appetites and their lusts, and we scorn men\nwho, through fear of pain, will dare no manly deed. But what wrong could such men be committing if\nthey looked merely to the senses as arbiters of good and evil? For it is to the senses that you and\nyours have entrusted the test of things to be sought and things to be avoided!", "Reason, however, is surely the governing element in such a matter as this; as reason has made the\ndecision concerning the happy life, and concerning virtue and honour also, so she has made the\ndecision with regard to good and evil. For with them the vilest part is allowed to give sentence about\nthe better, so that the senses ? dense as they are, and dull, and even more sluggish in man than in\nthe other animals, ? pass judgment on the Good. Just suppose that one should desire to distinguish\ntiny objects by the touch rather than by the eyesight! There is no special faculty more subtle and\nacute than the eye, that would enable us to distinguish between good and evil. You see, therefore,\nin what ignorance of truth a man spends his days and how abjectly he has overthrown lofty and\ndivine ideals, if he thinks that the sense of touch can pass judgment upon the nature of the Supreme\nGood and the Supreme Evil! He says: \"Just as every science and every art should possess an\nelement that is palpable and capable of being grasped by the senses (their source of origin and\ngrowth), even so the happy life derives its foundation and its beginnings from things that are\npalpable, and from that which falls within the scope of the senses. Surely you admit that the happy\nlife takes its beginnings from things palpable to the senses.\" But we define as \"happy\" those things\nthat are in accord with Nature. And that which is in accord with Nature is obvious and can be seen at\nonce ? just as easily as that which is complete. That which is according to Nature, that which is\ngiven us as a gift immediately at our birth, is, I maintain, not a Good, but the beginning of a Good.\nYou, however, assign the Supreme Good, pleasure, to mere babies, so that the child at its birth\nbegins at the point whither the perfected man arrives. You are placing the tree-top where the root\nought to be. If anyone should say that the child, hidden in its mother's womb, of unknown sex too,\ndelicate, unformed, and shapeless ? if one should say that this child is already in a state of\ngoodness, he would clearly seem to be astray in his ideas. And yet how little difference is there\nbetween one who has just lately received the gift of life, and one who is still a hidden burden in the\nbowels of the mother! They are equally developed, as far as their understanding of good or evil is\nconcerned; and a child is as yet no more capable of comprehending the Good than is a tree or any\ndumb beast.", "If a thing is difficult to be accomplished by thyself, do not think that it is impossible for man: but if\nanything is possible for man and conformable to his nature, think that this can be attained by thyself\ntoo.", "But why is the Good non-existent in a tree or in a dumb beast? Because there is no reason there,\neither. For the same cause, then, the Good is non-existent in a child, for the child also has no\nreason; the child will reach the Good only when he reaches reason. There are animals without\nreason, there are animals not yet endowed with reason, and there are animals who possess reason,\nbut only incompletely; in none of these does the Good exist, for it is reason that brings the Good in\nits company. What, then, is the distinction between the classes which I have mentioned? In that\nwhich does not possess reason, the Good will never exist. In that which is not yet endowed with\nreason, the Good cannot be existent at the time. And in that which possesses reason but only\nincompletely, the Good is capable of existing, but does not yet exist. This is what I mean, Lucilius:\nthe Good cannot be discovered in any random person, or at any random age; and it is as far\nremoved from infancy as last is from first, or as that which is complete from that which has just\nsprung into being. Therefore, it cannot exist in the delicate body, when the little frame has only just\nbegun to knit together. Of course not ? no more than in the seed. Granting\nthe truth of this, we understand that there is a certain kind of Good of a tree or in a plant; but this is\nnot true of its first growth, when the plant has just begun to spring forth out of the ground. There is a\ncertain Good of wheat: it is not yet existent, however, in the swelling stalk, nor when the soft ear is\npushing itself out of the husk, but only when summer days and its appointed maturity have ripened\nthe wheat. Just as Nature in general does not produce her Good until she is brought to perfection,\neven so man's Good does not exist in man until both reason and man are perfected. And what is\nthis Good? I shall tell you: it is a free mind, an upright mind, subjecting other things to itself and itself\nto nothing. So far is infancy from admitting this Good that boyhood has no hope of it, and even\nyoung manhood cherishes the hope without justification; even our old age is very fortunate if it has\nreached this Good after long and concentrated study. If this, then, is the Good, the good is a matter\nof the understanding.", "\"But,\" comes the retort, \"you admitted that there is a certain Good of trees and of grass; then surely\nthere can be a certain Good of a child also.\" But the true Good is not found in trees or in dumb\nanimals the Good which exists in them is called \"good\" only by courtesy. \"Then what is it?\" you say.\nSimply that which is in accord with the nature of each. The real Good cannot find a place in dumb\nanimals ? not by any means; its nature is more blest and is of a higher class. And where there is no\nplace for reason, the Good does not exist. There are four natures which we should mention here: of\nthe tree, animal, man, and God. The last two, having reasoning power, are of the same nature,\ndistinct only by virtue of the immortality of the one and the mortality of the other. Of one of these,\nthen ? to wit God ? it is Nature that perfects the Good; of the other ? to wit man ? pains and study\ndo so. All other things are perfect only in their particular nature, and not truly perfect, since they lack\nreason.", "Indeed, to sum up, that alone is perfect which is perfect according to nature as a whole, and nature\nas a whole is possessed of reason. Other things can be perfect according to their kind. That which\ncannot contain the happy life cannot contain that which produces the happy life; and the happy life is\nproduced by Goods alone. In dumb animals there is not a trace of the happy life, nor of the means\nwhereby the happy life is produced; in dumb animals the Good does not exist. The dumb animal\ncomprehends the present world about him through his senses alone. He remembers the past only\nby meeting with something which reminds his senses; a horse, for example, remembers the right\nroad only when he is placed at the starting-point. In his stall, however, he has no memory of the\nroad, no matter how often he may have stepped along it. The third state ? the future ? does not\ncome within the ken of dumb beasts.", "How, then, can we regard as perfect the nature of those who have no experience of time in its\nperfection? For time is three-fold, ? past, present, and future. Animals perceive only the time which\nis of greatest moment to them within the limits of their coming and going ? the present. Rarely do\nthey recollect the past ? and that only when they are confronted with present reminders. Therefore\nthe Good of a perfect nature cannot exist in an imperfect nature; for if the latter sort of nature should\npossess the Good, so also would mere vegetation. I do not indeed deny that dumb animals have\nstrong and swift impulses toward actions which seem according to nature, but such impulses are\nconfused and disordered. The Good however, is never confused or disordered.", "\"What!\" you say, \"do dumb animals move in disturbed and ill-ordered fashion?\" I should say that\nthey moved in disturbed and ill-ordered fashion, if their nature admitted of order; as it is, they move\nin accordance with their nature. For that is said to be \"disturbed\" which can also at some other time\nbe \"not disturbed\"; so, too, that is said to be in a state of trouble which can be in a state of peace.\nNo man is vicious except one who has the capacity of virtue; in the case of dumb animals their\nmotion is such as results from their nature. But, not to weary you, a certain sort of good will be found\nin a dumb animal, and a certain sort of virtue, and a certain sort of perfection ? but neither the Good,\nnor virtue, nor perfection in the absolute sense. For this is the privilege of reasoning beings alone,\nwho are permitted to know the cause, the degree, and the means. Therefore, good can exist only in\nthat which possesses reason.", "Do you ask now whither our argument is tending, and of what benefit it will be to your mind? I will tell\nyou: it exercises and sharpens the mind, and ensures, by occupying it honourably, that it will\naccomplish some sort of good. And even that is beneficial which holds men back when they are\nhurrying into wickedness. However, I will say this also: I can be of no greater benefit to you than by\nrevealing the Good that is rightly yours, by taking you out of the class of dumb animals, and by\nplacing you on a level with God. Why, pray, do you foster and practise your bodily strength? Nature\nhas granted strength in greater degree to cattle and wild beasts. Why cultivate your beauty? After all\nyour efforts, dumb animals surpass you in comeliness. Why dress your hair with such unending\nattention? Though you let it down in Parthian fashion, or tie it up in the German style, or, as the\nScythians do, let it flow wild ? yet you will see a mane of greater thickness tossing upon any horse\nyou choose, and a mane of greater beauty bristling upon the neck of any lion. And even after\ntraining yourself for speed, you will be no match for the hare. Are you not willing to abandon all\nthese details ? wherein you must acknowledge defeat, striving as you are for something that is not\nyour own ? and come back to the Good that is really yours?", "And what is this Good? It is a clear and flawless mind, which rivals that of God, raised far above\nmortal concerns, and counting nothing of its own to be outside itself. You are a reasoning animal.\nWhat Good, then, lies within you? Perfect reason. Are you willing to develop this to its farthest limits\n? to its greatest degree of increase? Only consider yourself happy when all your joys are born of\nreason, and when ? having marked all the objects which men clutch at, or pray for, or watch over ?\nyou find nothing which you will desire; mind, I do not say prefer. Here is a short rule by which to\nmeasure yourself, and by the test of which you may feel that you have reached perfection: \"You will\ncome to your own when you shall understand that those whom the world calls fortunate are really\nthe most unfortunate of all.\" Farewell.", "In the gymnastic exercises suppose that a man has torn thee with his nails, and by dashing against\nthy head has inflicted a wound.

For since the universal nature has made rational animals for the\nsake of one another to help one another according to their deserts, but in no way to injure one\nanother, he who transgresses her will, is clearly guilty of impiety towards the highest divinity. And he\ntoo who lies is guilty of impiety to the same divinity; for the universal nature is the nature of things\nthat are; and things that are have a relation to all things that come into existence. And further, this\nuniversal nature is named truth, and is the prime cause of all things that are true. He then who lies\nintentionally is guilty of impiety inasmuch as he acts unjustly by deceiving; and he also who lies\nunintentionally, inasmuch as he is at variance with the universal nature, and inasmuch as he\ndisturbs the order by fighting against the nature of the world; for he fights against it, who is moved of\nhimself to that which is contrary to truth, for he had received powers from nature through the neglect\nof which he is not able now to distinguish falsehood from truth. And indeed he who pursues pleasure\nas good, and avoids pain as evil, is guilty of impiety. For of necessity such a man must often find\nfault with the universal nature, alleging that it assigns things to the bad and the good contrary to\ntheir deserts, because frequently the bad are in the enjoyment of pleasure and possess the things\nwhich procure pleasure, but the good have pain for their share and the things which cause pain. And\nfurther, he who is afraid of pain will sometimes also be afraid of some of the things which will\nhappen in the world, and even this is impiety. And he who pursues pleasure will not abstain from\ninjustice, and this is plainly impiety. Now with respect to the things towards which the universal\nnature is equally affected- for it would not have made both, unless it was equally affected towards\nboth- towards these they who wish to follow nature should be of the same mind with it, and equally\naffected. With respect to pain, then, and pleasure, or death and life, or honour and dishonour, which\nthe universal nature employs equally, whoever is not equally affected is manifestly acting impiously.\nAnd I say that the universal nature employs them equally, instead of saying that they happen alike to\nthose who are produced in continuous series and to those who come after them by virtue of a\ncertain original movement of Providence, according to which it moved from a certain beginning to\nthis ordering of things, having conceived certain principles of the things which were to be, and", "having determined powers productive of beings and of changes and of such like successions.", "It would be a man's happiest lot to depart from mankind without having had any taste of lying and\nhypocrisy and luxury and pride. However to breathe out one's life when a man has had enough of\nthese things is the next best voyage, as the saying is. Hast thou determined to abide with vice, and\nhas not experience yet induced thee to fly from this pestilence? For the destruction of the\nunderstanding is a pestilence, much more indeed than any such corruption and change of this\natmosphere which surrounds us. For this corruption is a pestilence of animals so far as they are\nanimals; but the other is a pestilence of men so far as they are men.", "Do not despise death, but be well content with it, since this too is one of those things which nature\nwills. For such as it is to be young and to grow old, and to increase and to reach maturity, and to\nhave teeth and beard and grey hairs, and to beget, and to be pregnant and to bring forth, and all the\nother natural operations which the seasons of thy life bring, such also is dissolution. This, then, is\nconsistent with the character of a reflecting man, to be neither careless nor impatient nor\ncontemptuous with respect to death, but to wait for it as one of the operations of nature. As thou\nnow waitest for the time when the child shall come out of thy wife's womb, so be ready for the time\nwhen thy soul shall fall out of this envelope. But if thou requirest also a vulgar kind of comfort which\nshall reach thy heart, thou wilt be made best reconciled to death by observing the objects from\nwhich thou art going to be removed, and the morals of those with whom thy soul will no longer be\nmingled. For it is no way right to be offended with men, but it is thy duty to care for them and to bear\nwith them gently; and yet to remember that thy departure will be not from men who have the same\nprinciples as thyself. For this is the only thing, if there be any, which could draw us the contrary way\nand attach us to life, to be permitted to live with those who have the same principles as ourselves.\nBut now thou seest how great is the trouble arising from the discordance of those who live together,\nso that thou mayest say, Come quick, O death, lest perchance I, too, should forget myself.", "He who does wrong does wrong against himself.

Everything which is earthy turns towards the earth, everything which\nis liquid flows together, and everything which is of an aerial kind does the same, so that they require\nsomething to keep them asunder, and the application of force. Fire indeed moves upwards on\naccount of the elemental fire, but it is so ready to be kindled together with all the fire which is here,\nthat even every substance which is somewhat dry, is easily ignited, because there is less mingled\nwith it of that which is a hindrance to ignition. Accordingly then everything also which participates in\nthe common intelligent nature moves in like manner towards that which is of the same kind with\nitself, or moves even more. For so much as it is superior in comparison with all other things, in the\nsame degree also is it more ready to mingle with and to be fused with that which is akin to it.\nAccordingly among animals devoid of reason we find swarms of bees, and herds of cattle, and the\nnurture of young birds, and in a manner, loves; for even in animals there are souls, and that power\nwhich brings them together is seen to exert itself in the superior degree, and in such a way as never\nhas been observed in plants nor in stones nor in trees. But in rational animals there are political\ncommunities and friendships, and families and meetings of people; and in wars, treaties and\narmistices. But in the things which are still superior, even though they are separated from one\nanother, unity in a manner exists, as in the stars. Thus the ascent to the higher degree is able to\nproduce a sympathy even in things which are separated. See, then, what now takes place. For only\nintelligent animals have now forgotten this mutual desire and inclination, and in them alone the\nproperty of flowing together is not seen. But still though men strive to avoid this union, they are\ncaught and held by it, for their nature is too strong for them; and thou wilt see what I say, if thou only\nobservest. Sooner, then, will one find anything earthy which comes in contact with no earthy thing\nthan a man altogether separated from other men.", "Both man and God and the universe produce fruit; at the proper seasons each produces it.

And the ears\nof corn bending down, and the lion's eyebrows, and the foam which flows from the mouth of wild\nboars, and many other things- though they are far from being beautiful, if a man should examine\nthem severally- still, because they are consequent upon the things which are formed by nature, help\nto adorn them, and they please the mind; so that if a man should have a feeling and deeper insight\nwith respect to the things which are produced in the universe, there is hardly one of those which\nfollow by way of consequence which will not seem to him to be in a manner disposed so as to give\npleasure. And so he will see even the real gaping jaws of wild beasts with no less pleasure than\nthose which painters and sculptors show by imitation; and in an old woman and an old man he will\nbe able to see a certain maturity and comeliness; and the attractive loveliness of young persons he\nwill be able to look on with chaste eyes; and many such things will present themselves, not pleasing\nto every man, but to him only who has become truly familiar with nature and her works.", "The periodic movements of the universe are the same, up and down from age to age.

For\nwhether did nature herself design to do evil to the things which are parts of herself, and to make\nthem subject to evil and of necessity fall into evil, or have such results happened without her\nknowing it? Both these suppositions, indeed, are incredible. But if a man should even drop the term\nNature (as an efficient power), and should speak of these things as natural, even then it would be\nridiculous to affirm at the same time that the parts of the whole are in their nature subject to change,\nand at the same time to be surprised or vexed as if something were happening contrary to nature,\nparticularly as the dissolution of things is into those things of which each thing is composed. For\nthere is either a dispersion of the elements out of which everything has been compounded, or a\nchange from the solid to the earthy and from the airy to the aerial, so that these parts are taken back\ninto the universal reason, whether this at certain periods is consumed by fire or renewed by eternal\nchanges. And do not imagine that the solid and the airy part belong to thee from the time of\ngeneration. For all this received its accretion only yesterday and the day before, as one may say,\nfrom the food and the air which is inspired. This, then, which has received the accretion, changes,\nnot that which thy mother brought forth. But suppose that this which thy mother brought forth\nimplicates thee very much with that other part, which has the peculiar quality of change, this is\nnothing in fact in the way of objection to what is said.", "When thou hast assumed these names, good, modest, true, rational, a man of equanimity, and\nmagnanimous, take care that thou dost not change these names; and if thou shouldst lose them,\nquickly return to them. And remember that the term Rational was intended to signify a discriminating\nattention to every several thing and freedom from negligence; and that Equanimity is the voluntary\nacceptance of the things which are assigned to thee by the common nature; and that Magnanimity is\nthe elevation of the intelligent part above the pleasurable or painful sensations of the flesh, and\nabove that poor thing called fame, and death, and all such things. If, then, thou maintainest thyself in\nthe possession of these names, without desiring to be called by these names by others, thou wilt be\nanother person and wilt enter on another life. For to continue to be such as thou hast hitherto been,\nand to be tom in pieces and defiled in such a life, is the character of a very stupid man and one\noverfond of his life, and like those half-devoured fighters with wild beasts, who though covered with\nwounds and gore, still intreat to be kept to the following day, though they will be exposed in the\nsame state to the same claws and bites. Therefore fix thyself in the possession of these few names:\nand if thou art able to abide in them, abide as if thou wast removed to certain islands of the Happy.\nBut if thou shalt perceive that thou fallest out of them and dost not maintain thy hold, go\ncourageously into some nook where thou shalt maintain them, or even depart at once from life, not\nin passion, but with simplicity and freedom and modesty, after doing this one laudable thing at least\nin thy life, to have gone out of it thus. In order, however, to the remembrance of these names, it will\ngreatly help thee, if thou rememberest the gods, and that they wish not to be flattered, but wish all\nreasonable beings to be made like themselves; and if thou rememberest that what does the work of\na fig-tree is a fig-tree, and that what does the work of a dog is a dog, and that what does the work of\na bee is a bee, and that what does the work of a man is a man.", "Mimi, war, astonishment, torpor, slavery, will daily wipe out those holy principles of thine.

For if these things are according to nature,\nrejoice in them, and they will be easy to thee: but if contrary to nature, seek what is conformable to\nthy own nature, and strive towards this, even if it bring no reputation; for every man is allowed to\nseek his own good.", "Consider whence each thing is come, and of what it consists, and into what it changes, and what\nkind of a thing it will be when it has changed, and that it will sustain no harm.", "Throwing away then all things, hold to these only which are few; and besides bear in mind that every\nman lives only this present time, which is an indivisible point, and that all the rest of his life is either\npast or it is uncertain.

Take away these opinions then, and\nresolve to dismiss thy judgement about an act as if it were something grievous, and thy anger is\ngone. How then shall I take away these opinions?

And let this truth be present to thee in the excitement\nof anger, that to be moved by passion is not manly, but that mildness and gentleness, as they are\nmore agreeable to human nature, so also are they more manly; and he who possesses these\nqualities possesses strength, nerves and courage, and not the man who is subject to fits of passion\nand discontent. For in the same degree in which a man's mind is nearer to freedom from all passion,\nin the same degree also is it nearer to strength: and as the sense of pain is a characteristic of\nweakness, so also is anger.

For nothing is so\nproductive of elevation of mind as to be able to examine methodically and truly every object which is\npresented to thee in life, and always to look at things so as to see at the same time what kind of\nuniverse this is, and what kind of use everything performs in it, and what value everything has with\nreference to the whole, and what with reference to man, who is a citizen of the highest city, of which\nall other cities are like families; what each thing is, and of what it is composed, and how long it is the\nnature of this thing to endure which now makes an impression on me, and what virtue I have need\nof with respect to it, such as gentleness, manliness, truth, fidelity, simplicity, contentment, and the\nrest.

And yet no force is imposed on it, but only those things which are conformable to its nature:\nstill it does not submit, but is carried in the opposite direction. For the movement towards injustice\nand intemperance and to anger and grief and fear is nothing else than the act of one who deviates\nfrom nature. And also when the ruling faculty is discontented with anything that happens, then too it\ndeserts its post: for it is constituted for piety and reverence towards the gods no less than for justice.\nFor these qualities also are comprehended under the generic term of contentment with the\nconstitution of things, and indeed they are prior to acts of justice.", "He who has not one and always the same object in life, cannot be one and the same all through his\nlife.

Be\ncareful, however, lest this reading of many authors and books of every sort may tend to make you\ndiscursive and unsteady. You must linger among a limited number of master-thinkers, and digest\ntheir works, if you would derive ideas which shall win firm hold in your mind. Everywhere means\nnowhere.

And the same thing must hold true of men who seek intimate\nacquaintance with no single author, but visit them all in a hasty and hurried manner. Food does no\ngood and is not assimilated into the body if it leaves the stomach as soon as it is eaten; nothing\nhinders a cure so much as frequent change of medicine; no wound will heal when one salve is tried\nafter another; a plant which is often moved can never grow strong.

And in reading of many books is distraction.", "Accordingly, since you cannot read all the books which you may possess, it is enough to possess\nonly as many books as you can read. \"But,\" you reply, \"I wish to dip first into one book and then into\nanother.\" I tell you that it is the sign of an overnice appetite to toy with many dishes; for when they\nare manifold and varied, they cloy but do not nourish. So you should always read standard authors;\nand when you crave a change, fall back upon those whom you read before. Each day acquire\nsomething that will fortify you against poverty, against death, indeed against other misfortunes as\nwell; and after you have run over many thoughts, select one to be thoroughly digested that day. This\nis my own custom; from the many things which I have read, I claim some one part for myself.", "The thought for to-day is one which I discovered in Epicurus; for I am wont to cross over even into\nthe enemy's camp, ? not as a deserter, but as a scout. He says: \"Contented poverty is an\nhonourable estate.\" Indeed, if it be contented, it is not poverty at all. It is not the man who has too\nlittle, but the man who craves more, that is poor. What does it matter how much a man has laid up in\nhis safe, or in his warehouse, how large are his flocks and how fat his dividends, if he covets his\nneighbour's property, and reckons, not his past gains, but his hopes of gains to come? Do you ask\nwhat is the proper limit to wealth? It is, first, to have what is necessary, and, second, to have what is\nenough. Farewell.", "You have sent a letter to me through the hand of a \"friend\" of yours, as you call him. And in your\nvery next sentence you warn me not to discuss with him all the matters that concern you, saying that\neven you yourself are not accustomed to do this; in other words, you have in the same letter\naffirmed and denied that he is your friend. Now if you used this word of ours in the popular sense,\nand called him \"friend\" in the same way in which we speak of all candidates for election as\n\"honourable gentlemen,\" and as we greet all men whom we meet casually, if their names slip us for\nthe moment, with the salutation \"my dear sir,\" ? so be it. But if you consider any man a friend whom\nyou do not trust as you trust yourself, you are mightily mistaken and you do not sufficiently\nunderstand what true friendship means. Indeed, I would have you discuss everything with a friend;\nbut first of all discuss the man himself. When friendship is settled, you must trust; before friendship\nis formed, you must pass judgment. Those persons indeed put last first and confound their duties,\nwho, violating the rules of Theophrastus, judge a man after they have made him their friend, instead\nof making him their friend after they have judged him. Ponder for a long time whether you shall\nadmit a given person to your friendship; but when you have decided to admit him, welcome him with\nall your heart and soul. Speak as boldly with him as with yourself. As to yourself, although you\nshould live in such a way that you trust your own self with nothing which you could not entrust even\nto your enemy, yet, since certain matters occur which convention keeps secret, you should share\nwith a friend at least all your worries and reflections. Regard him as loyal, and you will make him\nloyal. Some, for example, fearing to be deceived, have taught men to deceive; by their suspicions\nthey have given their friend the right to do wrong. Why need I keep back any words in the presence\nof my friend? Why should I not regard myself as alone when in his company?", "There is a class of men who communicate, to anyone whom they meet, matters which should be\nrevealed to friends alone, and unload upon the chance listener whatever irks them. Others, again,\nfear to confide in their closest intimates; and if it were possible, they would not trust even\nthemselves, burying their secrets deep in their hearts. But we should do neither. It is equally faulty to\ntrust everyone and to trust no one. Yet the former fault is, I should say, the more ingenuous, the\nlatter the more safe. In like manner you should rebuke these two kinds of men, ? both those who\nalways lack repose, and those who are always in repose. For love of bustle is not industry, ? it is\nonly the restlessness of a hunted mind. And true repose does not consist in condemning all motion\nas merely vexation; that kind of repose is slackness and inertia. Therefore, you should note the\nfollowing saying, taken from my reading in Pomponius: \"Some men shrink into dark corners, to such\na degree that they see darkly by day.\" No, men should combine these tendencies, and he who\nreposes should act and he who acts should take repose. Discuss the problem with Nature; she will\ntell you that she has created both day and night. Farewell.", "Keep on as you have begun, and make all possible haste, so that you may have longer enjoyment\nof an improved mind, one that is at peace with itself. Doubtless you will derive enjoyment during the\ntime when you are improving your mind and setting it at peace with itself; but quite different is the\npleasure which comes from contemplation when one's mind is so cleansed from every stain that it\nshines. You remember, of course, what joy you felt when you laid aside the garments of boyhood\nand donned the man's toga, and were escorted to the forum; nevertheless, you may look for a still\ngreater joy when you have laid aside the mind of boyhood and when wisdom has enrolled you\namong men. For it is not boyhood that still stays with us, but something worse, ? boyishness. And\nthis condition is all the more serious because we possess the authority of old age, together with the\nfollies of boyhood, yea, even the follies of infancy. Boys fear trifles, children fear shadows, we fear\nboth.", "All you need to do is to advance; you will thus understand that some things are less to be dreaded,\nprecisely because they inspire us with great fear. No evil is great which is the last evil of all. Death\narrives; it would be a thing to dread, if it could remain with you. But death must either not come at\nall, or else must come and pass away.", "\"It is difficult, however,\" you say, \"to bring the mind to a point where it can scorn life.\" But do you not\nsee what trifling reasons impel men to scorn life? One hangs himself before the door of his mistress;\nanother hurls himself from the house-top that he may no longer be compelled to bear the taunts of a\nbad-tempered master; a third, to be saved from arrest after running away, drives a sword into his\nvitals. Do you not suppose that virtue will be as efficacious as excessive fear? No man can have a\npeaceful life who thinks too much about lengthening it, or believes that living through many\nconsulships is a great blessing. Rehearse this thought every day, that you may be able to depart\nfrom life contentedly; for many men clutch and cling to life, even as those who are carried down a\nrushing stream clutch and cling to briars and sharp rocks.", "That which rules within, when it is according to nature, is so affected with respect to the events\nwhich happen, that it always easily adapts itself to that which is and is presented to it. For it requires\nno definite material, but it moves towards its purpose, under certain conditions however; and it\nmakes a material for itself out of that which opposes it, as fire lays hold of what falls into it, by which\na small light would have been extinguished: but when the fire is strong, it soon appropriates to itself\nthe matter which is heaped on it, and consumes it, and rises higher by means of this very material.", "Most men ebb and flow in wretchedness between the fear of death and the hardships of life; they\nare unwilling to live, and yet they do not know how to die. For this reason, make life as a whole\nagreeable to yourself by banishing all worry about it. No good thing renders its possessor happy,\nunless his mind is reconciled to the possibility of loss; nothing, however, is lost with less discomfort\nthan that which, when lost, cannot be missed. Therefore, encourage and toughen your spirit against\nthe mishaps that afflict even the most powerful. For example, the fate of Pompey was settled by a\nboy and a eunuch, that of Crassus by a cruel and insolent Parthian. Gaius Caesar ordered Lepidus\nto bare his neck for the axe of the tribune Dexter; and he himself offered his own throat to Chaerea.\nNo man has ever been so far advanced by Fortune that she did not threaten him as greatly as she\nhad previously indulged him. Do not trust her seeming calm; in a moment the sea is moved to its\ndepths. The very day the ships have made a brave show in the games, they are engulfed. Reflect\nthat a highwayman or an enemy may cut your throat; and, though he is not your master, every slave\nwields the power of life and death over you. Therefore I declare to you: he is lord of your life that\nscorns his own. Think of those who have perished through plots in their own homes, slain either\nopenly or by guile; you will then understand that just as many have been killed by angry slaves as\nby angry kings. What matter, therefore, how powerful he be whom you fear, when every one\npossesses the power which inspires your fear? \"But,\" you will say, \"if you should chance to fall into\nthe hands of the enemy, the conqueror will command that you be led away,\" ? yes, whither you are\nalready being led. Why do you voluntarily deceive yourself and require to be told now for the first\ntime what fate it is that you have long been labouring under? Take my word for it: since the day you\nwere born you are being led thither. We must ponder this thought, and thoughts of the like nature, if\nwe desire to be calm as we await that last hour, the fear of which makes all previous hours uneasy.", "But I must end my letter. Let me share with you the saying which pleased me to-day. It, too, is culled\nfrom another man's Garden: \"Poverty brought into conformity with the law of nature, is great wealth.\"\nDo you know what limits that law of nature ordains for us? Merely to avert hunger, thirst, and cold. In\norder to banish hunger and thirst, it is not necessary for you to pay court at the doors of the\npurse-proud, or to submit to the stern frown, or to the kindness that humiliates; nor is it necessary for\nyou to scour the seas, or go campaigning; nature's needs are easily provided and ready to hand. It\nis the superfluous things for which men sweat, ? the superfluous things that wear our togas\nthreadbare, that force us to grow old in camp, that dash us upon foreign shores. That which is\nenough is ready to our hands. He who has made a fair compact with poverty is rich. Farewell.", "I commend you and rejoice in the fact that you are persistent in your studies, and that, putting all\nelse aside, you make it each day your endeavour to become a better man. I do not merely exhort\nyou to keep at it; I actually beg you to do so. I warn you, however, not to act after the fashion of\nthose who desire to be conspicuous rather than to improve, by doing things which will rouse\ncomment as regards your dress or general way of living. Repellent attire, unkempt hair, slovenly\nbeard, open scorn of silver dishes, a couch on the bare earth, and any other perverted forms of\nself-display, are to be avoided. The mere name of philosophy, however quietly pursued, is an object\nof sufficient scorn; and what would happen if we should begin to separate ourselves from the\ncustoms of our fellow-men? Inwardly, we ought to be different in all respects, but our exterior should\nconform to society. Do not wear too fine, nor yet too frowzy, a toga. One needs no silver plate,\nencrusted and embossed in solid gold; but we should not believe the lack of silver and gold to be\nproof of the simple life. Let us try to maintain a higher standard of life than that of the multitude, but\nnot a contrary standard; otherwise, we shall frighten away and repel the very persons whom we are\ntrying to improve. We also bring it about that they are unwilling to imitate us in anything, because\nthey are afraid lest they might be compelled to imitate us in everything.", "The first thing which philosophy undertakes to give is fellow-feeling with all men; in other words,\nsympathy and sociability. We part company with our promise if we are unlike other men. We must\nsee to it that the means by which we wish to draw admiration be not absurd and odious. Our motto,\nas you know, is \"Live according to Nature\"; but it is quite contrary to nature to torture the body, to\nhate unlaboured elegance, to be dirty on purpose, to eat food that is not only plain, but disgusting\nand forbidding. Just as it is a sign of luxury to seek out dainties, so it is madness to avoid that which\nis customary and can be purchased at no great price. Philosophy calls for plain living, but not for\npenance; and we may perfectly well be plain and neat at the same time. This is the mean of which I\napprove; our life should observe a happy medium between the ways of a sage and the ways of the\nworld at large; all men should admire it, but they should understand it also.", "\"Well then, shall we act like other men? Shall there be no distinction between ourselves and the\nworld?\" Yes, a very great one; let men find that we are unlike the common herd, if they look closely.\nIf they visit us at home, they should admire us, rather than our household appointments. He is a\ngreat man who uses earthenware dishes as if they were silver; but he is equally great who uses\nsilver as if it were earthenware. It is the sign of an unstable mind not to be able to endure riches.", "But I wish to share with you to-day's profit also. I find in the writings of our Hecato that the limiting of\ndesires helps also to cure fears: \"Cease to hope,\" he says, \"and you will cease to fear.\" \"But how,\"\nyou will reply, \"can things so different go side by side?\" In this way, my dear Lucilius: though they do\nseem at variance, yet they are really united. Just as the same chain fastens the prisoner and the\nsoldier who guards him, so hope and fear, dissimilar as they are, keep step together; fear follows\nhope. I am not surprised that they proceed in this way; each alike belongs to a mind that is in\nsuspense, a mind that is fretted by looking forward to the future. But the chief cause of both these\nills is that we do not adapt ourselves to the present, but send our thoughts a long way ahead. And\nso foresight, the noblest blessing of the human race, becomes perverted. Beasts avoid the dangers\nwhich they see, and when they have escaped them are free from care; but we men torment\nourselves over that which is to come as well as over that which is past. Many of our blessings bring\nbane to us; for memory recalls the tortures of fear, while foresight anticipates them. The present\nalone can make no man wretched. Farewell.", "I feel, my dear Lucilius, that I am being not only reformed, but transformed. I do not yet, however,\nassure myself, or indulge the hope, that there are no elements left in me which need to be changed.\nOf course there are many that should be made more compact, or made thinner, or be brought into\ngreater prominence. And indeed this very fact is proof that my spirit is altered into something better,\n? that it can see its own faults, of which it was previously ignorant. In certain cases sick men are\ncongratulated because they themselves have perceived that they are sick.", "I therefore wish to impart to you this sudden change in myself; I should then begin to place a surer\ntrust in our friendship, ? the true friendship which hope and fear and self-interest cannot sever, the\nfriendship in which and for the sake of which men meet death. I can show you many who have\nlacked, not a friend, but a friendship; this, however, cannot possibly happen when souls are drawn\ntogether by identical inclinations into an alliance of honourable desires. And why can it not happen?\nBecause in such cases men know that they have all things in common, especially their troubles.", "You cannot conceive what distinct progress I notice that each day brings to me. And when you say:\n\"Give me also a share in these gifts which you have found so helpful,\" I reply that I am anxious to\nheap all these privileges upon you, and that I am glad to learn in order that I may teach. Nothing will\never please me, no matter how excellent or beneficial, if I must retain the knowledge of it to myself.\nAnd if wisdom were given me under the express condition that it must be kept hidden and not\nuttered, I should refuse it. No good thing is pleasant to possess, without friends to share it.", "I shall therefore send to you the actual books; and in order that you may not waste time in searching\nhere and there for profitable topics, I shall mark certain passages, so that you can turn at once to\nthose which I approve and admire. Of course, however, the living voice and the intimacy of a\ncommon life will help you more than the written word. You must go to the scene of action, first,\nbecause men put more faith in their eyes than in their ears, and second, because the way is long if\none follows precepts, but short and helpful, if one follows patterns. Cleanthes could not have been\nthe express image of Zeno, if he had merely heard his lectures; he shared in his life, saw into his\nhidden purposes, and watched him to see whether he lived according to his own rules. Plato,\nAristotle, and the whole throng of sages who were destined to go each his different way, derived\nmore benefit from the character than from the words of Socrates. It was not the class-room of\nEpicurus, but living together under the same roof, that made great men of Metrodorus, Hermarchus,\nand Polyaenus. Therefore I summon you, not merely that you may derive benefit, but that you may\nconfer benefit; for we can assist each other greatly.", "Let no act be done without a purpose, nor otherwise than according to the perfect principles of art.", "Meanwhile, I owe you my little daily contribution; you shall be told what pleased me to-day in the\nwritings of Hecato; it is these words: \"What progress, you ask, have I made? I have begun to be a\nfriend to myself.\" That was indeed a great benefit; such a person can never be alone. You may be\nsure that such a man is a friend to all mankind. Farewell.", "Do you ask me what you should regard as especially to be avoided? I say, crowds; for as yet you\ncannot trust yourself to them with safety. I shall admit my own weakness, at any rate; for I never\nbring back home the same character that I took abroad with me. Something of that which I have\nforced to be calm within me is disturbed; some of the foes that I have routed return again. Just as\nthe sick man, who has been weak for a long time, is in such a condition that he cannot be taken out\nof the house without suffering a relapse, so we ourselves are affected when our souls are\nrecovering from a lingering disease. To consort with the crowd is harmful; there is no person who\ndoes not make some vice attractive to us, or stamp it upon us, or taint us unconsciously therewith.\nCertainly, the greater the mob with which we mingle, the greater the danger.", "But nothing is so damaging to good character as the habit of lounging at the games; for then it is\nthat vice steals subtly upon one through the avenue of pleasure. What do you think I mean? I mean\nthat I come home more greedy, more ambitious, more voluptuous, and even more cruel and\ninhuman, ? because I have been among human beings. By chance I attended a mid-day exhibition,\nexpecting some fun, wit, and relaxation, ? an exhibition at which men's eyes have respite from the\nslaughter of their fellow-men. But it was quite the reverse. The previous combats were the essence\nof compassion; but now all the trifling is put aside and it is pure murder. The men have no defensive\narmour. They are exposed to blows at all points, and no one ever strikes in vain. Many persons\nprefer this programme to the usual pairs and to the bouts \"by request.\" Of course they do; there is\nno helmet or shield to deflect the weapon. What is the need of defensive armour, or of skill? All\nthese mean delaying death. In the morning they throw men to the lions and the bears; at noon, they\nthrow them to the spectators. The spectators demand that the slayer shall face the man who is to\nslay him in his turn; and they always reserve the latest conqueror for another butchering. The\noutcome of every fight is death, and the means are fire and sword. This sort of thing goes on while\nthe arena is empty. You may retort: \"But he was a highway robber; he killed a man!\" And what of it?\nGranted that, as a murderer, he deserved this punishment, what crime have you committed, poor\nfellow, that you should deserve to sit and see this show? In the morning they cried \"Kill him! Lash\nhim! Burn him! Why does he meet the sword in so cowardly a way? Why does he strike so feebly?\nWhy doesn't he die game? Whip him to meet his wounds! Let them receive blow for blow, with\nchests bare and exposed to the stroke!\" And when the games stop for the intermission, they\nannounce: \"A little throat-cutting in the meantime, so that there may still be something going on!\"", "Come now; do you not understand even this truth, that a bad example reacts on the agent? Thank\nthe immortal gods that you are teaching cruelty to a person who cannot learn to be cruel. The young\ncharacter, which cannot hold fast to righteousness, must be rescued from the mob; it is too easy to\nside with the majority. Even Socrates, Cato, and Laelius might have been shaken in their moral\nstrength by a crowd that was unlike them; so true it is that none of us, no matter how much he\ncultivates his abilities, can withstand the shock of faults that approach, as it were, with so great a\nretinue. Much harm is done by a single case of indulgence or greed; the familiar friend, if he be\nluxurious, weakens and softens us imperceptibly; the neighbour, if he be rich, rouses our\ncovetousness; the companion, if he be slanderous, rubs off some of his rust upon us, even though\nwe be spotless and sincere. What then do you think the effect will be on character, when the world\nat large assaults it! You must either imitate or loathe the world.", "But both courses are to be avoided; you should not copy the bad simply because they are many, nor\nshould you hate the many because they are unlike you. Withdraw into yourself, as far as you can.\nAssociate with those who will make a better man of you. Welcome those whom you yourself can\nimprove. The process is mutual; for men learn while they teach. There is no reason why pride in\nadvertising your abilities should lure you into publicity, so that you should desire to recite or\nharangue before the general public. Of course I should be willing for you to do so if you had a\nstock-in-trade that suited such a mob; as it is, there is not a man of them who can understand you.\nOne or two individuals will perhaps come in your way, but even these will have to be moulded and\ntrained by you so that they will understand you. You may say: \"For what purpose did I learn all these\nthings?\" But you need not fear that you have wasted your efforts; it was for yourself that you learned\nthem.", "In order, however, that I may not to-day have learned exclusively for myself, I shall share with you\nthree excellent sayings, of the same general purport, which have come to my attention. This letter\nwill give you one of them as payment of my debt; the other two you may accept as a contribution in\nadvance. Democritus says: \"One man means as much to me as a multitude, and a multitude only as\nmuch as one man.\" The following also was nobly spoken by someone or other, for it is doubtful who\nthe author was; they asked him what was the object of all this study applied to an art that would\nreach but very few. He replied: \"I am content with few, content with one, content with none at all.\"\nThe third saying ? and a noteworthy one, too ? is by Epicurus, written to one of the partners of his\nstudies: \"I write this not for the many, but for you; each of us is enough of an audience for the other.\"\nLay these words to heart, Lucilius, that you may scorn the pleasure which comes from the applause\nof the majority. Many men praise you; but have you any reason for being pleased with yourself, if\nyou are a person whom the many can understand? Your good qualities should face inwards.\nFarewell.", "\"Do you bid me,\" you say, \"shun the throng, and withdraw from men, and be content with my own\nconscience? Where are the counsels of your school, which order a man to die in the midst of active\nwork?\" As to the course which I seem to you to be urging on you now and then, my object in\nshutting myself up and locking the door is to be able to help a greater number. I never spend a day\nin idleness; I appropriate even a part of the night for study. I do not allow time for sleep but yield to it\nwhen I must, and when my eyes are wearied with waking and ready to fall shut, I keep them at their\ntask. I have withdrawn not only from men, but from affairs, especially from my own affairs; I am\nworking for later generations, writing down some ideas that may be of assistance to them. There are\ncertain wholesome counsels, which may be compared to prescriptions of useful drugs; these I am\nputting into writing; for I have found them helpful in ministering to my own sores, which, if not wholly\ncured, have at any rate ceased to spread.", "I point other men to the right path, which I have found late in life, when wearied with wandering. I cry\nout to them: \"Avoid whatever pleases the throng: avoid the gifts of Chance! Halt before every good\nwhich Chance brings to you, in a spirit of doubt and fear; for it is the dumb animals and fish that are\ndeceived by tempting hopes. Do you call these things the 'gifts' of Fortune? They are snares. And\nany man among you who wishes to live a life of safety will avoid, to the utmost of his power, these\nlimed twigs of her favour, by which we mortals, most wretched in this respect also, are deceived; for\nwe think that we hold them in our grasp, but they hold us in theirs. Such a career leads us into\nprecipitous ways, and life on such heights ends in a fall. Moreover, we cannot even stand up against\nprosperity when she begins to drive us to leeward; nor can we go down, either, 'with the ship at least\non her course,' or once for all; Fortune does not capsize us, ? she plunges our bows under and\ndashes us on the rocks.", "\"Hold fast, then, to this sound and wholesome rule of life; that you indulge the body only so far as is\nneedful for good health. The body should be treated more rigorously, that it may not be disobedient\nto the mind. Eat merely to relieve your hunger; drink merely to quench your thirst; dress merely to\nkeep out the cold; house yourself merely as a protection against personal discomfort. It matters little\nwhether the house be built of turf, or of variously coloured imported marble; understand that a man\nis sheltered just as well by a thatch as by a roof of gold. Despise everything that useless toil creates\nas an ornament and an object of beauty. And reflect that nothing except the soul is worthy of\nwonder; for to the soul, if it be great, naught is great.\"", "When I commune in such terms with myself and with future generations, do you not think that I am\ndoing more good than when I appear as counsel in court, or stamp my seal upon a will, or lend my\nassistance in the senate, by word or action, to a candidate? Believe me, those who seem to be\nbusied with nothing are busied with the greater tasks; they are dealing at the same time with things\nmortal and things immortal.", "Men seek retreats for themselves, houses in the country, sea-shores, and mountains; and thou too\nart wont to desire such things very much. But this is altogether a mark of the most common sort of\nmen, for it is in thy power whenever thou shalt choose to retire into thyself. For nowhere either with\nmore quiet or more freedom from trouble does a man retire than into his own soul, particularly when\nhe has within him such thoughts that by looking into them he is immediately in perfect tranquility;\nand I affirm that tranquility is nothing else than the good ordering of the mind. Constantly then give\nto thyself this retreat, and renew thyself; and let thy principles be brief and fundamental, which, as\nsoon as thou shalt recur to them, will be sufficient to cleanse the soul completely, and to send thee\nback free from all discontent with the things to which thou returnest. For with what art thou\ndiscontented? With the badness of men? Recall to thy mind this conclusion, that rational animals\nexist for one another, and that to endure is a part of justice, and that men do wrong involuntarily;\nand consider how many already, after mutual enmity, suspicion, hatred, and fighting, have been\nstretched dead, reduced to ashes; and be quiet at last.- But perhaps thou art dissatisfied with that\nwhich is assigned to thee out of the universe.- Recall to thy recollection this alternative; either there\nis providence or atoms, fortuitous concurrence of things; or remember the arguments by which it has\nbeen proved that the world is a kind of political community, and be quiet at last.- But perhaps\ncorporeal things will still fasten upon thee.- Consider then further that the mind mingles not with the\nbreath, whether moving gently or violently, when it has once drawn itself apart and discovered its\nown power, and think also of all that thou hast heard and assented to about pain and pleasure, and\nbe quiet at last.- But perhaps the desire of the thing called fame will torment thee.- See how soon\neverything is forgotten, and look at the chaos of infinite time on each side of the present, and the\nemptiness of applause, and the changeableness and want of judgement in those who pretend to\ngive praise, and the narrowness of the space within which it is circumscribed, and be quiet at last.\nFor the whole earth is a point, and how small a nook in it is this thy dwelling, and how few are there\nin it, and what kind of people are they who will praise thee.", "But I must stop, and pay my customary contribution, to balance this letter. The payment shall not be\nmade from my own property; for I am still conning Epicurus. I read to-day, in his works, the following\nsentence: \"If you would enjoy real freedom, you must be the slave of Philosophy.\" The man who\nsubmits and surrenders himself to her is not kept waiting; he is emancipated on the spot. For the\nvery service of Philosophy is freedom.", "It is likely that you will ask me why I quote so many of Epicurus's noble words instead of words\ntaken from our own school. But is there any reason why you should regard them as sayings of\nEpicurus and not common property? How many poets give forth ideas that have been uttered, or\nmay be uttered, by philosophers! I need not touch upon the tragedians and our writers of national\ndrama; for these last are also somewhat serious, and stand half-way between comedy and tragedy.\nWhat a quantity of sagacious verses lie buried in the mime! How many of Publilius's lines are worthy\nof being spoken by buskin-clad actors, as well as by wearers of the slipper! I shall quote one verse\nof his, which concerns philosophy, and particularly that phase of it which we were discussing a\nmoment ago, wherein he says that the gifts of Chance are not to be regarded as part of our\npossessions:", "Still alien is whatever you have gained\nBy coveting.", "I recall that you yourself expressed this idea much more happily and concisely:", "And a third, spoken by you still more happily, shall not be omitted:", "I shall not charge this up to the expense account, because I have given it to you from your own\nstock. Farewell.", "You desire to know whether Epicurus is right when, in one of his letters, he rebukes those who hold\nthat the wise man is self-sufficient and for that reason does not stand in need of friendships. This is\nthe objection raised by Epicurus against Stilbo and those who believe that the Supreme Good is a\nsoul which is insensible to feeling.", "We are bound to meet with a double meaning if we try to express the Greek term \"lack of feeling\"\nsummarily, in a single word, rendering it by the Latin word impatientia. For it may be understood in\nthe meaning the opposite to that which we wish it to have. What we mean to express is, a soul\nwhich rejects any sensation of evil; but people will interpret the idea as that of a soul which can\nendure no evil. Consider, therefore, whether it is not better to say \"a soul that cannot be harmed,\" or\n\"a soul entirely beyond the realm of suffering.\" There is this difference between ourselves and the\nother school: our ideal wise man feels his troubles, but overcomes them; their wise man does not\neven feel them. But we and they alike hold this idea, ? that the wise man is self-sufficient.\nNevertheless, he desires friends, neighbours, and associates, no matter how much he is sufficient\nunto himself. And mark how self-sufficient he is; for on occasion he can be content with a part of\nhimself. If he lose a hand through disease or war, or if some accident puts out one or both of his\neyes, he will be satisfied with what is left, taking as much pleasure in his impaired and maimed body\nas he took when it was sound. But while he does not pine for these parts if they are missing, he\nprefers not to lose them. In this sense the wise man is self-sufficient, that he can do without friends,\nnot that he desires to do without them. When I say \"can,\" I mean this: he endures the loss of a friend\nwith equanimity.", "This then remains: Remember to retire into this little territory of thy own, and above all do not\ndistract or strain thyself, but be free, and look at things as a man, as a human being, as a citizen, as\na mortal. But among the things readiest to thy hand to which thou shalt turn, let there be these,\nwhich are two. One is that things do not touch the soul, for they are external and remain immovable;\nbut our perturbations come only from the opinion which is within. The other is that all these things,\nwhich thou seest, change immediately and will no longer be; and constantly bear in mind how many\nof these changes thou hast already witnessed. The universe is transformation: life is opinion.", "But he need never lack friends, for it lies in his own control how soon he shall make good a loss.\nJust as Phidias, if he lose a statue, can straightway carve another, even so our master in the art of\nmaking friendships can fill the place of a friend he has lost. If you ask how one can make oneself a\nfriend quickly, I will tell you, provided we are agreed that I may pay my debt at once and square the\naccount, so far as this letter is concerned. Hecato, says: \"I can show you a philtre, compounded\nwithout drugs, herbs, or any witch's incantation: 'If you would be loved, love.'\" Now there is great\npleasure, not only in maintaining old and established friendships, but also in beginning and acquiring\nnew ones. There is the same difference between winning a new friend and having already won him,\nas there is between the farmer who sows and the farmer who reaps. The philosopher Attalus used\nto say: \"It is more pleasant to make than to keep a friend, as it is more pleasant to the artist to paint\nthan to have finished painting.\" When one is busy and absorbed in one's work, the very absorption\naffords great delight; but when one has withdrawn one's hand from the completed masterpiece, the\npleasure is not so keen. Henceforth it is the fruits of his art that he enjoys; it was the art itself that he\nenjoyed while he was painting. In the case of our children, their young manhood yields the more\nabundant fruits, but their infancy was sweeter.", "Let us now return to the question. The wise man, I say, self-sufficient though he be, nevertheless\ndesires friends if only for the purpose of practising friendship, in order that his noble qualities may\nnot lie dormant. Not, however, for the purpose mentioned by Epicurus in the letter quoted above:\n\"That there may be someone to sit by him when he is ill, to help him when he is in prison or in want;\"\nbut that he may have someone by whose sick-bed he himself may sit, someone a prisoner in hostile\nhands whom he himself may set free. He who regards himself only, and enters upon friendships for\nthis reason, reckons wrongly. The end will be like the beginning: he has made friends with one who\nmight assist him out of bondage; at the first rattle of the chain such a friend will desert him. These\nare the so-called \"fair-weather\" friendships; one who is chosen for the sake of utility will be\nsatisfactory only so long as he is useful. Hence prosperous men are blockaded by troops of friends;\nbut those who have failed stand amid vast loneliness, their friends fleeing from the very crisis which\nis to test their worth. Hence, also, we notice those many shameful cases of persons who, through\nfear, desert or betray. The beginning and the end cannot but harmonize. He who begins to be your\nfriend because it pays will also cease because it pays. A man will be attracted by some reward\noffered in exchange for his friendship, if he be attracted by aught in friendship other than friendship\nitself.", "For what purpose, then, do I make a man my friend? In order to have someone for whom I may die,\nwhom I may follow into exile, against whose death I may stake my own life, and pay the pledge, too.\nThe friendship which you portray is a bargain and not a friendship; it regards convenience only, and\nlooks to the results. Beyond question the feeling of a lover has in it something akin to friendship; one\nmight call it friendship run mad. But, though this is true, does anyone love for the sake of gain, or\npromotion, or renown? Pure love, careless of all other things, kindles the soul with desire for the\nbeautiful object, not without the hope of a return of the affection. What then? Can a cause which is\nmore honourable produce a passion that is base? You may retort: \"We are not now discussing the\nquestion whether friendship is to be cultivated for its own sake.\" On the contrary, nothing more\nurgently requires demonstration; for if friendship is to be sought for its own sake, he may seek it who\nis self-sufficient. \"How, then,\" you ask, \"does he seek it?\" Precisely as he seeks an object of great\nbeauty, not attracted to it by desire for gain, nor yet frightened by the instability of Fortune. One who\nseeks friendship for favourable occasions, strips it of all its nobility.", "\"The wise man is self-sufficient.\" This phrase, my dear Lucilius, is incorrectly explained by many; for\nthey withdraw the wise man from the world, and force him to dwell within his own skin. But we must\nmark with care what this sentence signifies and how far it applies; the wise man is sufficient unto\nhimself for a happy existence, but not for mere existence. For he needs many helps towards mere\nexistence; but for a happy existence he needs only a sound and upright soul, one that despises\nFortune.", "I should like also to state to you one of the distinctions of Chrysippus, who declares that the wise\nman is in want of nothing, and yet needs many things. \"On the other hand,\" he says, \"nothing is\nneeded by the fool, for he does not understand how to use anything, but he is in want of everything.\"\nThe wise man needs hands, eyes, and many things that are necessary for his daily use; but he is in\nwant of nothing. For want implies a necessity, and nothing is necessary to the wise man. Therefore,\nalthough he is self-sufficient, yet he has need of friends. He craves as many friends as possible, not,\nhowever, that he may live happily; for he will live happily even without friends. The Supreme Good\ncalls for no practical aids from outside; it is developed at home, and arises entirely within itself. If the\ngood seeks any portion of itself from without, it begins to be subject to the play of Fortune.", "People may say: \"But what sort of existence will the wise man have, if he be left friendless when\nthrown into prison, or when stranded in some foreign nation, or when delayed on a long voyage, or\nwhen cast upon a lonely shore?\" His life will be like that of Jupiter, who, amid the dissolution of the\nworld, when the gods are confounded together and Nature rests for a space from her work, can\nretire into himself and give himself over to his own thoughts. In some such way as this the sage will\nact; he will retreat into himself, and live with himself. As long as he is allowed to order his affairs\naccording to his judgment, he is self-sufficient ? and marries a wife; he is self-sufficient ? and brings\nup children; he is self-sufficient ? and yet could not live if he had to live without the society of man.\nNatural promptings, and not his own selfish needs, draw him into friendships. For just as other\nthings have for us an inherent attractiveness, so has friendship. As we hate solitude and crave\nsociety, as nature draws men to each other, so in this matter also there is an attraction which makes\nus desirous of friendship. Nevertheless, though the sage may love his friends dearly, often\ncomparing them with himself, and putting them ahead of himself, yet all the good will be limited to\nhis own being, and he will speak the words which were spoken by the very Stilbo whom Epicurus\ncriticizes in his letter. For Stilbo, after his country was captured and his children and his wife lost, as\nhe emerged from the general desolation alone and yet happy, spoke as follows to Demetrius, called\nSacker of Cities because of the destruction he brought upon them, in answer to the question\nwhether he had lost anything: \"I have all my goods with me!\" There is a brave and stout-hearted\nman for you! The enemy conquered, but Stilbo conquered his conqueror. \"I have lost nothing!\" Aye,\nhe forced Demetrius to wonder whether he himself had conquered after all. \"My goods are all with\nme!\" In other words, he deemed nothing that might be taken from him to be a good.", "We marvel at certain animals because they can pass through fire and suffer no bodily harm; but how\nmuch more marvellous is a man who has marched forth unhurt and unscathed through fire and\nsword and devastation! Do you understand now how much easier it is to conquer a whole tribe than\nto conquer one man? This saying of Stilbo makes common ground with Stoicism; the Stoic also can\ncarry his goods unimpaired through cities that have been burned to ashes; for he is self-sufficient.\nSuch are the bounds which he sets to his own happiness.", "But you must not think that our school alone can utter noble words; Epicurus himself, the reviler of\nStilbo, spoke similar language; put it down to my credit, though I have already wiped out my debt for\nthe present day. He says: \"Whoever does not regard what he has as most ample wealth, is\nunhappy, though he be master of the whole world.\" Or, if the following seems to you a more suitable\nphrase, ? for we must try to render the meaning and not the mere words: \"A man may rule the world\nand still be unhappy, if he does not feel that he is supremely happy.\" In order, however, that you\nmay know that these sentiments are universal, suggested, of course, by Nature, you will find in one\nof the comic poets this verse:", "For what does your condition matter, if it is bad in your own eyes? You may say: \"What then? If\nyonder man, rich by base means, and yonder man, lord of many but slave of more, shall call\nthemselves happy, will their own opinion make them happy?\" It matters not what one says, but what\none feels; also, not how one feels on one particular day, but how one feels at all times. There is no\nreason, however, why you should fear that this great privilege will fall into unworthy hands; only the\nwise man is pleased with his own. Folly is ever troubled with weariness of itself. Farewell.", "If our intellectual part is common, the reason also, in respect of which we are rational beings, is\ncommon: if this is so, common also is the reason which commands us what to do, and what not to\ndo; if this is so, there is a common law also; if this is so, we are fellow-citizens; if this is so, we are\nmembers of some political community; if this is so, the world is in a manner a state. For of what\nother common political community will any one say that the whole human race are members? And\nfrom thence, from this common political community comes also our very intellectual faculty and\nreasoning faculty and our capacity for law; or whence do they come? For as my earthly part is a\nportion given to me from certain earth, and that which is watery from another element, and that\nwhich is hot and fiery from some peculiar source (for nothing comes out of that which is nothing, as\nnothing also returns to non-existence), so also the intellectual part comes from some source.", "Yes, I do not change my opinion: avoid the many, avoid the few, avoid even the individual. I know of\nno one with whom I should be willing to have you shared. And see what an opinion of you I have; for\nI dare to trust you with your own self. Crates, they say, the disciple of the very Stilbo whom I\nmentioned in a former letter, noticed a young man walking by himself, and asked him what he was\ndoing all alone. \"I am communing with myself,\" replied the youth. \"Pray be careful, then,\" said\nCrates, \"and take good heed; you are communing with a bad man!\"", "When persons are in mourning, or fearful about something, we are accustomed to watch them that\nwe may prevent them from making a wrong use of their loneliness. No thoughtless person ought to\nbe left alone; in such cases he only plans folly, and heaps up future dangers for himself or for\nothers; he brings into play his base desires; the mind displays what fear or shame used to repress; it\nwhets his boldness, stirs his passions, and goads his anger. And finally, the only benefit that\nsolitude confers, ? the habit of trusting no man, and of fearing no witnesses, ? is lost to the fool; for\nhe betrays himself.", "Mark therefore what my hopes are for you, ? nay, rather, what I am promising myself, inasmuch as\nhope is merely the title of an uncertain blessing: I do not know any person with whom I should prefer\nyou to associate rather than yourself. I remember in what a great-souled way you hurled forth\ncertain phrases, and how full of strength they were! I immediately congratulated myself and said:\n\"These words did not come from the edge of the lips; these utterances have a solid foundation. This\nman is not one of the many; he has regard for his real welfare.\" Speak, and live, in this way; see to it\nthat nothing keeps you down. As for your former prayers, you may dispense the gods from\nanswering them; offer new prayers; pray for a sound mind and for good health, first of soul and then\nof body. And of course you should offer those prayers frequently. Call boldly upon God; you will not\nbe asking him for that which belongs to another.", "But I must, as is my custom, send a little gift along with this letter. It is a true saying which I have\nfound in Athenodorus: \"Know that thou art freed from all desires when thou hast reached such a\npoint that thou prayest to God for nothing except what thou canst pray for openly.\" But how foolish\nmen are now! They whisper the basest of prayers to heaven; but if anyone listens, they are silent at\nonce. That which they are unwilling for men to know, they communicate to God. Do you not think,\nthen, that some such wholesome advice as this could be given you: \"Live among men as if God\nbeheld you; speak with God as if men were listening\"? Farewell.", "Your friend and I have had a conversation. He is a man of ability; his very first words showed what\nspirit and understanding he possesses, and what progress he has already made. He gave me a\nforetaste, and he will not fail to answer thereto. For he spoke not from forethought, but was suddenly\ncaught off his guard. When he tried to collect himself, he could scarcely banish that hue of modesty,\nwhich is a good sign in a young man; the blush that spread over his face seemed so to rise from the\ndepths. And I feel sure that his habit of blushing will stay with him after he has strengthened his\ncharacter, stripped off all his faults, and become wise. For by no wisdom can natural weaknesses of\nthe body be removed. That which is implanted and inborn can be toned down by training, but not\novercome. The steadiest speaker, when before the public, often breaks into a perspiration, as if he\nhad wearied or over-heated himself; some tremble in the knees when they rise to speak; I know of\nsome whose teeth chatter, whose tongues falter, whose lips quiver. Training and experience can\nnever shake off this habit; nature exerts her own power and through such a weakness makes her\npresence known even to the strongest. I know that the blush, too, is a habit of this sort, spreading\nsuddenly over the faces of the most dignified men. It is, indeed more prevalent in youth, because of\nthe warmer blood and the sensitive countenance; nevertheless, both seasoned men and aged men\nare affected by it. Some are most dangerous when they redden, as if they were letting all their sense\nof shame escape. Sulla, when\nthe blood mantled his cheeks, was in his fiercest mood. Pompey had the most sensitive cast of\ncountenance; he always blushed in the presence of a gathering, and especially at a public\nassembly. Fabianus also, I remember, reddened when he appeared as a witness before the senate;\nand his embarrassment became him to a remarkable degree. Such a habit is not due to mental\nweakness, but to the novelty of a situation; an inexperienced person is not necessarily confused, but\nis usually affected, because he slips into this habit by natural tendency of the body. Just as certain\nmen are full-blooded, so others are of a quick and mobile blood, that rushes to the face at once.", "As I remarked, Wisdom can never remove this habit; for if she could rub out all our faults, she would\nbe mistress of the universe. Whatever is assigned to us by the terms of our birth and the blend in\nour constitutions, will stick with us, no matter how hard or how long the soul may have tried to\nmaster itself. And we cannot forbid these feelings any more than we can summon them. Actors in\nthe theatre, who imitate the emotions, who portray fear and nervousness, who depict sorrow, imitate\nbashfulness by hanging their heads, lowering their voices, and keeping their eyes fixed and rooted\nupon the ground. They cannot, however, muster a blush; for the blush cannot be prevented or\nacquired. Wisdom will not assure us of a remedy, or give us help against it; it comes or goes\nunbidden, and is a law unto itself.", "But my letter calls for its closing sentence. Hear and take to heart this useful and wholesome motto:\n\"Cherish some man of high character, and keep him ever before your eyes, living as if he were\nwatching you, and ordering all your actions as if he beheld them.\" Such, my dear Lucilius, is the\ncounsel of Epicurus; he has quite properly given us a guardian and an attendant. We can get rid of\nmost sins, if we have a witness who stands near us when we are likely to go wrong. The soul should\nhave someone whom it can respect, ? one by whose authority it may make even its inner shrine\nmore hallowed. Happy is the man who can make others better, not merely when he is in their\ncompany, but even when he is in their thoughts! And happy also is he who can so revere a man as\nto calm and regulate himself by calling him to mind! One who can so revere another, will soon be\nhimself worthy of reverence. Choose therefore a Cato; or, if Cato seems too severe a model, choose\nsome Laelius, a gentler spirit. Choose a master whose life, conversation, and soul-expressing face\nhave satisfied you; picture him always to yourself as your protector or your pattern. For we must\nindeed have someone according to whom we may regulate our characters; you can never straighten\nthat which is crooked unless you use a ruler. Farewell.", "Wherever I turn, I see evidences of my advancing years. I visited lately my country-place, and\nprotested against the money which was spent on the tumble-down building. My bailiff maintained\nthat the flaws were not due to his own carelessness; \"he was doing everything possible, but the\nhouse was old.\" And this was the house which grew under my own hands! What has the future in\nstore for me, if stones of my own age are already crumbling? I was angry, and I embraced the first\nopportunity to vent my spleen in the bailiff's presence. \"It is clear,\" I cried, \"that these plane-trees are\nneglected; they have no leaves. Their branches are so gnarled and shrivelled; the boles are so\nrough and unkempt! This would not happen, if someone loosened the earth at their feet, and\nwatered them.\" The bailiff swore by my protecting deity that \"he was doing everything possible, and\nnever relaxed his efforts, but those trees were old.\" Between you and me, I had planted those trees\nmyself, I had seen them in their first leaf. Then I turned to the door and asked: \"Who is that\nbroken-down dotard? You have done well to place him at the entrance; for he is outward bound.\nWhere did you get him? What pleasure did it give you to take up for burial some other man's dead?\"\nBut the slave said: \"Don't you know me, sir? I am Felicio; you used to bring me little images. My\nfather was Philositus the steward, and I am your pet slave.\" \"The man is clean crazy,\" I remarked.\n\"Has my pet slave become a little boy again? But it is quite possible; his teeth are just dropping out.\"", "I owe it to my country-place that my old age became apparent whithersoever I turned. Let us cherish\nand love old age; for it is full of pleasure if one knows how to use it. Fruits are most welcome when\nalmost over; youth is most charming at its close; the last drink delights the toper, ? the glass which\nsouses him and puts the finishing touch on his drunkenness. Each pleasure reserves to the end the\ngreatest delights which it contains. Life is most delightful when it is on the downward slope, but has\nnot yet reached the abrupt decline. And I myself believe that the period which stands, so to speak,\non the edge of the roof, possesses pleasures of its own. Or else the very fact of our not wanting\npleasures has taken the place of the pleasures themselves. How comforting it is to have tired out\none's appetites, and to have done with them! \"But,\" you say, \"it is a nuisance to be looking death in\nthe face!\" Death, however, should be looked in the face by young and old alike. We are not\nsummoned according to our rating on the censor's list. Moreover, no one is so old that it would be\nimproper for him to hope for another day of existence. And one day, mind you, is a stage on life's\njourney.", "Our span of life is divided into parts; it consists of large circles enclosing smaller. One circle\nembraces and bounds the rest; it reaches from birth to the last day of existence. The next circle\nlimits the period of our young manhood. The third confines all of childhood in its circumference.\nAgain, there is, in a class by itself, the year; it contains within itself all the divisions of time by the\nmultiplication of which we get the total of life. The month is bounded by a narrower ring. The\nsmallest circle of all is the day; but even a day has its beginning and its ending, its sunrise and its\nsunset. Hence Heraclitus, whose obscure style gave him his surname, remarked: \"One day is equal\nto every day.\" Different persons have interpreted the saying in different ways. Some hold that days\nare equal in number of hours, and this is true; for if by \"day\" we mean twenty-four hours' time, all\ndays must be equal, inasmuch as the night acquires what the day loses. But others maintain that\none day is equal to all days through resemblance, because the very longest space of time\npossesses no element which cannot be found in a single day, ? namely, light and darkness, ? and\neven to eternity day makes these alternations more numerous, not different when it is shorter and\ndifferent again when it is longer. Hence, every day ought to be regulated as if it closed the series, as\nif it rounded out and completed our existence.", "Death is such as generation is, a mystery of nature; a composition out of the same elements, and a\ndecomposition into the same; and altogether not a thing of which any man should be ashamed, for it\nis not contrary to the nature of a reasonable animal, and not contrary to the reason of our\nconstitution.", "Pacuvius, who by long occupancy made Syria his own, used to hold a regular burial sacrifice in his\nown honour, with wine and the usual funeral feasting, and then would have himself carried from the\ndining-room to his chamber, while eunuchs applauded and sang in Greek to a musical\naccompaniment: \"He has lived his life, he has lived his life!\" Thus Pacuvius had himself carried out\nto burial every day. Let us, however, do from a good motive what he used to do from a debased\nmotive; let us go to our sleep with joy and gladness; let us say:", "I have lived; the course which Fortune set for me\nIs finished.", "And if God is pleased to add another day, we should welcome it with glad hearts. That man is\nhappiest, and is secure in his own possession of himself, who can await the morrow without\napprehension. When a man has said: \"I have lived!\", every morning he arises he receives a bonus.", "But now I ought to close my letter. \"What?\" you say; \"shall it come to me without any little offering?\"\nBe not afraid; it brings something, ? nay, more than something, a great deal. For what is more noble\nthan the following saying of which I make this letter the bearer: \"It is wrong to live under constraint;\nbut no man is constrained to live under constraint.\" Of course not. On all sides lie many short and\nsimple paths to freedom; and let us thank God that no man can be kept in life. We may spurn the\nvery constraints that hold us. \"Epicurus,\" you reply, \"uttered these words; what are you doing with\nanother's property?\" Any truth, I maintain, is my own property. And I shall continue to heap\nquotations from Epicurus upon you, so that all persons who swear by the words of another, and put\na value upon the speaker and not upon the thing spoken, may understand that the best ideas are\ncommon property. Farewell.", "I know that you have plenty of spirit; for even before you began to equip yourself with maxims which\nwere wholesome and potent to overcome obstacles, you were taking pride in your contest with\nFortune; and this is all the more true, now that you have grappled with Fortune and tested your\npowers. For our powers can never inspire in us implicit faith in ourselves except when many\ndifficulties have confronted us on this side and on that, and have occasionally even come to close\nquarters with us. It is only in this way that the true spirit can be tested, ? the spirit that will never\nconsent to come under the jurisdiction of things external to ourselves. This is the touchstone of such\na spirit; no prizefighter can go with high spirits into the strife if he has never been beaten black and\nblue; the only contestant who can confidently enter the lists is the man who has seen his own blood,\nwho has felt his teeth rattle beneath his opponent's fist, who has been tripped and felt the full force\nof his adversary's charge, who has been downed in body but not in spirit, one who, as often as he\nfalls, rises again with greater defiance than ever. So then, to keep up my figure, Fortune has often in\nthe past got the upper hand of you, and yet you have not surrendered, but have leaped up and\nstood your ground still more eagerly. For manliness gains much strength by being challenged;\nnevertheless, if you approve, allow me to offer some additional safeguards by which you may fortify\nyourself.", "There are more things, Lucilius, likely to frighten us than there are to crush us; we suffer more often\nin imagination than in reality. I am not speaking with you in the Stoic strain but in my milder style.\nFor it is our Stoic fashion to speak of all those things, which provoke cries and groans, as\nunimportant and beneath notice; but you and I must drop such great-sounding words, although,\nHeaven knows, they are true enough. What I advise you to do is, not to be unhappy before the crisis\ncomes; since it may be that the dangers before which you paled as if they were threatening you, will\nnever come upon you; they certainly have not yet come. Accordingly, some things torment us more\nthan they ought; some torment us before they ought; and some torment us when they ought not to\ntorment us at all. We are in the habit of exaggerating, or imagining, or anticipating, sorrow.", "The first of these three faults may be postponed for the present, because the subject is under\ndiscussion and the case is still in court, so to speak. That which I should call trifling, you will maintain\nto be most serious; for of course I know that some men laugh while being flogged, and that others\nwince at a box on the ear. We shall consider later whether these evils derive their power from their\nown strength, or from our own weakness.", "Do me the favour, when men surround you and try to talk you into believing that you are unhappy, to\nconsider not what you hear but what you yourself feel, and to take counsel with your feelings and\nquestion yourself independently, because you know your own affairs better than anyone else does.\nAsk: \"Is there any reason why these persons should condole with me? Why should they be worried\nor even fear some infection from me, as if troubles could be transmitted? Is there any evil involved,\nor is it a matter merely of ill report, rather than an evil?\" Put the question voluntarily to yourself: \"Am\nI tormented without sufficient reason, am I morose, and do I convert what is not an evil into what is\nan evil?\" You may retort with the question: \"How am I to know whether my sufferings are real or\nimaginary?\" Here is the rule for such matters: We are tormented either by things present, or by\nthings to come, or by both. As to things present, the decision is easy. Suppose that your person\nenjoys freedom and health, and that you do not suffer from any external injury. As to what may\nhappen to it in the future, we shall see later on. To-day there is nothing wrong with it. \"But,\" you say,\n\"something will happen to it.\" First of all, consider whether your proofs of future trouble are sure. For\nit is more often the case that we are troubled by our apprehensions, and that we are mocked by that\nmocker, rumour, which is wont to settle wars, but much more often settles individuals. Yes, my dear\nLucilius; we agree too quickly with what people say. We do not put to the test those things which\ncause our fear; we do not examine into them; we blench and retreat just like soldiers who are forced\nto abandon their camp because of a dust-cloud raised by stampeding cattle, or are thrown into a\npanic by the spreading of some unauthenticated rumour. And somehow or other it is the idle report\nthat disturbs us most. For truth has its own definite boundaries, but that which arises from\nuncertainty is delivered over to guesswork and the irresponsible license of a frightened mind. That is\nwhy no fear is so ruinous and so uncontrollable as panic fear. For other fears are groundless, but\nthis fear is witless.", "Let us, then, look carefully into the matter. It is likely that some troubles will befall us; but it is not a\npresent fact. How often has the unexpected happened! How often has the expected never come to\npass! And even though it is ordained to be, what does it avail to run out to meet your suffering? You\nwill suffer soon enough, when it arrives; so look forward meanwhile to better things. What shall you\ngain by doing this? Time. There will be many happenings meanwhile which will serve to postpone,\nor end, or pass on to another person, the trials which are near or even in your very presence. A fire\nhas opened the way to flight. Men have been let down softly by a catastrophe. Sometimes the sword\nhas been checked even at the victim's throat. Men have survived their own executioners. Even bad\nfortune is fickle. Perhaps it will come, perhaps not; in the meantime it is not. So look forward to\nbetter things.", "The mind at times fashions for itself false shapes of evil when there are no signs that point to any\nevil; it twists into the worst construction some word\nof doubtful meaning; or it fancies some personal grudge to be more serious than it really is,\nconsidering not how angry the enemy is, but to what lengths he may go if he is angry. But life is not\nworth living, and there is no limit to our sorrows, if we indulge our fears to the greatest possible\nextent; in this matter, let prudence help you, and contemn with a resolute spirit even when it is in\nplain sight. If you cannot do this, counter one weakness with another, and temper your fear with\nhope. There is nothing so certain among these objects of fear that it is not more certain still that\nthings we dread sink into nothing and that things we hope for mock us.", "It is natural that these things should be done by such persons, it is a matter of necessity; and if a\nman will not have it so, he will not allow the fig-tree to have juice. But by all means bear this in mind,\nthat within a very short time both thou and he will be dead; and soon not even your names will be\nleft behind.", "Accordingly, weigh carefully your hopes as well as your fears, and whenever all the elements are in\ndoubt, decide in your own favour; believe what you prefer. And if fear wins a majority of the votes,\nincline in the other direction anyhow, and cease to harass your soul, reflecting continually that most\nmortals, even when no troubles are actually at hand or are certainly to be expected in the future,\nbecome excited and disquieted. No one calls a halt on himself, when he begins to be urged ahead;\nnor does he regulate his alarm according to the truth. No one says; \"The author of the story is a fool,\nand he who has believed it is a fool, as well as he who fabricated it.\" We let ourselves drift with\nevery breeze; we are frightened at uncertainties, just as if they were certain. We observe no\nmoderation. The slightest thing turns the scales and throws us forthwith into a panic.", "But I am ashamed either to admonish you sternly or to try to beguile you with such mild remedies.\nLet another say: \"Perhaps the worst will not happen.\" You yourself must say: \"Well, what if it does\nhappen? Let us see who wins! Perhaps it happens for my best interests; it may be that such a death\nwill shed credit upon my life.\" Socrates was ennobled by the hemlock draught. Wrench from Cato's\nhand his sword, the vindicator of liberty, and you deprive him of the greatest share of his glory. I am\nexhorting you far too long, since you need reminding rather than exhortation. The path on which I\nam leading you is not different from that on which your nature leads you; you were born to such\nconduct as I describe. Hence there is all the more reason why you should increase and beautify the\ngood that is in you.", "But now, to close my letter, I have only to stamp the usual seal upon it, in other words, to commit\nthereto some noble message to be delivered to you: \"The fool, with all his other faults, has this also,\n? he is always getting ready to live.\" Reflect, my esteemed Lucilius, what this saying means, and\nyou will see how revolting is the fickleness of men who lay down every day new foundations of life,\nand begin to build up fresh hopes even at the brink of the grave. Look within your own mind for\nindividual instances; you will think of old men who are preparing themselves at that very hour for a\npolitical career, or for travel, or for business. And what is baser than getting ready to live when you\nare already old? I should not name the author of this motto, except that it is somewhat unknown to\nfame and is not one of those popular sayings of Epicurus which I have allowed myself to praise and\nto appropriate. Farewell.", "I confess that we all have an inborn affection for our body; I confess that we are entrusted with its\nguardianship. I do not maintain that the body is not to be indulged at all; but I maintain that we must\nnot be slaves to it. He will have many masters who makes his body his master, who is over-fearful in\nits behalf, who judges everything according to the body. We should conduct ourselves not as if we\nought to live for the body, but as if we could not live without it. Our too great love for it makes us\nrestless with fears, burdens us with cares, and exposes us to insults. Virtue is held too cheap by the\nman who counts his body too dear. We should cherish the body with the greatest care; but we\nshould also be prepared, when reason, self-respect, and duty demand the sacrifice, to deliver it\neven to the flames.", "Let us, however, in so far as we can, avoid discomforts as well as dangers, and withdraw to safe\nground, by thinking continually how we may repel all objects of fear. If I am not mistaken, there are\nthree main classes of these: we fear want, we fear sickness, and we fear the troubles which result\nfrom the violence of the stronger. And of all these, that which shakes us most is the dread which\nhangs over us from our neighbour's ascendancy; for it is accompanied by great outcry and uproar.\nBut the natural evils which I have mentioned, ? want and sickness, ? steal upon us silently with no\nshock of terror to the eye or to the ear. The other kind of evil comes, so to speak, in the form of a\nhuge parade. Surrounding it is a retinue of swords and fire and chains and a mob of beasts to be let\nloose upon the disembowelled entrails of men. Picture to yourself under this head the prison, the\ncross, the rack, the hook, and the stake which they drive straight through a man until it protrudes\nfrom his throat. Think of human limbs torn apart by chariots driven in opposite directions, of the\nterrible shirt smeared and interwoven with inflammable materials, and of all the other contrivances\ndevised by cruelty, in addition to those which I have mentioned! It is not surprising, then, if our\ngreatest terror is of such a fate; for it comes in many shapes and its paraphernalia are terrifying. For\njust as the torturer accomplishes more in proportion to the number of instruments which he displays,\n? indeed, the spectacle overcomes those who would have patiently withstood the suffering, ?\nsimilarly, of all the agencies which coerce and master our minds, the most effective are those which\ncan make a display. Those other troubles are of course not less serious; I mean hunger, thirst,\nulcers of the stomach, and fever that parches our very bowels. They are, however, secret; they have\nno bluster and no heralding; but these, like huge arrays of war, prevail by virtue of their display and\ntheir equipment.", "Let us, therefore, see to it that we abstain from giving offence. It is sometimes the people that we\nought to fear; or sometimes a body of influential oligarchs in the Senate, if the method of governing\nthe State is such that most of the business is done by that body; and sometimes individuals\nequipped with power by the people and against the people. It is burdensome to keep the friendship\nof all such persons; it is enough not to make enemies of them. So the wise man will never provoke\nthe anger of those in power; nay, he will even turn his course, precisely as he would turn from a\nstorm if he were steering a ship. When you travelled to Sicily, you crossed the Straits. The reckless\npilot scorned the blustering South Wind, ? the wind which roughens the Sicilian Sea and forces it\ninto choppy currents; he sought not the shore on the left, but the strand hard by the place where\nCharybdis throws the seas into confusion. Your more careful pilot, however, questions those who\nknow the locality as to the tides and the meaning of the clouds; he holds his course far from that\nregion notorious for its swirling waters. Our wise man does the same; he shuns a strong man who\nmay be injurious to him, making a point of not seeming to avoid him, because an important part of\none's safety lies in not seeking safety openly; for what one avoids, one condemns.", "We should therefore look about us, and see how we may protect ourselves from the mob. And first\nof all, we should have no cravings like theirs; for rivalry results in strife. Again, let us possess\nnothing that can be snatched from us to the great profit of a plotting foe. Let there be as little booty\nas possible on your person. No one sets out to shed the blood of his fellow-men for the sake of\nbloodshed, ? at any rate very few. More murderers speculate on their profits than give vent to\nhatred. If you are empty-handed, the highwayman passes you by; even along an infested road, the\npoor may travel in peace. Next, we must follow the old adage and avoid three things with special\ncare: hatred, jealousy, and scorn. And wisdom alone can show you how this may be done. It is hard\nto observe a mean; we must be chary of letting the fear of jealousy lead us into becoming objects of\nscorn, lest, when we choose not to stamp others down, we let them think that they can stamp us\ndown. The power to inspire fear has caused many men to be in fear. Let us withdraw ourselves in\nevery way; for it is as harmful to be scorned as to be admired.", "One must therefore take refuge in philosophy; this pursuit, not only in the eyes of good men, but\nalso in the eyes of those who are even moderately bad, is a sort of protecting emblem. For\nspeechmaking at the bar, or any other pursuit that claims the people's attention, wins enemies for a\nman; but philosophy is peaceful and minds her own business. Men cannot scorn her; she is\nhonoured by every profession, even the vilest among them. Evil can never grow so strong, and\nnobility of character can never be so plotted against, that the name of philosophy shall cease to be\nworshipful and sacred.", "Philosophy itself, however, should be practised with calmness and moderation. \"Very well, then,\"\nyou retort, \"do you regard the philosophy of Marcus Cato as moderate? Cato's voice strove to check\na civil war. Cato parted the swords of maddened chieftains. When some fell foul of Pompey and\nothers fell foul of Caesar, Cato defied both parties at once!\" Nevertheless, one may well question\nwhether, in those days, a wise man ought to have taken any part in public affairs, and ask: \"What do\nyou mean, Marcus Cato? It is not now a question of freedom; long since has freedom gone to rack\nand ruin. The question is, whether it is Caesar or Pompey who controls the State. Why, Cato, should\nyou take sides in that dispute? It is no business of yours; a tyrant is being selected. What does it\nconcern you who conquers? The better man may win; but the winner is bound to be the worse man.\"\nI have referred to Cato's final r\u00f4le. But even in previous years the wise man was not permitted to\nintervene in such plundering of the state; for what could Cato do but raise his voice and utter\nunavailing words? At one time he was \"hustled\" by the mob and spat upon and forcibly removed\nfrom the forum and marked for exile; at another, he was taken straight to prison from the\nsenate-chamber.", "However, we shall consider later whether the wise man ought to give his attention to politics;\nmeanwhile, I beg you to consider those Stoics who, shut out from public life, have withdrawn into\nprivacy for the purpose of improving men's existence and framing laws for the human race without\nincurring the displeasure of those in power. The wise man will not upset the customs of the people,\nnor will he invite the attention of the populace by any novel ways of living.", "Take away thy opinion, and then there is taken away the complaint, \"I have been harmed.\" Take\naway the complaint, \"I have been harmed,\" and the harm is taken away.", "\"What then? Can one who follows out this plan be safe in any case?\" I cannot guarantee you this\nany more than I can guarantee good health in the case of a man who observes moderation;\nalthough, as a matter of fact, good health results from such moderation. Sometimes a vessel\nperishes in harbour; but what do you think happens on the open sea? And how much more beset\nwith danger that man would be, who even in his leisure is not secure, if he were busily working at\nmany things! Innocent persons sometimes perish; who would deny that? But the guilty perish more\nfrequently. A soldier's skill is not at fault if he receives the death-blow through his armour. And\nfinally, the wise man\nregards the reason for all his actions, but not the results. The beginning is in our own power; fortune\ndecides the issue, but I do not allow her to pass sentence upon myself. You may say: \"But she can\ninflict a measure of suffering and of trouble.\" The highwayman does not pass sentence when he\nslays.", "Now you are stretching forth your hand for the daily gift. Golden indeed will be the gift with which I\nshall load you; and, inasmuch as we have mentioned gold, let me tell you how its use and\nenjoyment may bring you greater pleasure. \"He who needs riches least, enjoys riches most.\"\n\"Author's name, please!\" you say. Now, to show you how generous I am, it is my intent to praise the\ndicta of other schools. The phrase belongs to Epicurus, or Metrodorus, or some one of that\nparticular thinking-shop. But what difference does it make who spoke the words? They were uttered\nfor the world. He who craves riches feels fear on their account. No man, however, enjoys a blessing\nthat brings anxiety; he is always trying to add a little more. While he puzzles over increasing his\nwealth, he forgets how to use it. He collects his accounts, he wears out the pavement in the forum,\nhe turns over his ledger, ? in short, he ceases to be master and becomes a steward. Farewell.", "The old Romans had a custom which survived even into my lifetime. They would add to the opening\nwords of a letter: \"If you are well, it is well; I also am well.\" Persons like ourselves would do well to\nsay: \"If you are studying philosophy, it is well.\" For this is just what \"being well\" means. Without\nphilosophy the mind is sickly, and the body, too, though it may be very powerful, is strong only as\nthat of a madman or a lunatic is strong. This, then, is the sort of health you should primarily cultivate;\nthe other kind of health comes second, and will involve little effort, if you wish to be well physically. It\nis indeed foolish, my dear Lucilius, and very unsuitable for a cultivated man, to work hard over\ndeveloping the muscles and broadening the shoulders and strengthening the lungs. For although\nyour heavy feeding produce good results and your sinews grow solid, you can never be a match,\neither in strength or in weight, for a first-class bull. Besides, by overloading the body with food you\nstrangle the soul and render it less active. Accordingly, limit the flesh as much as possible, and allow\nfree play to the spirit. Many inconveniences beset those who devote themselves to such pursuits. In\nthe first place, they have their exercises, at which they must work and waste their life-force and\nrender it less fit to bear a strain or the severer studies. Second, their keen edge is dulled by heavy\neating. Besides, they must take orders from slaves of the vilest stamp, ? men who alternate between\nthe oil-flask and the flagon, whose day passes satisfactorily if they have got up a good perspiration\nand quaffed, to make good what they have lost in sweat, huge draughts of liquor which will sink\ndeeper because of their fasting. Drinking and sweating, ? it's the life of a dyspeptic!", "Now there are short and simple exercises which tire the body rapidly, and so save our time; and\ntime is something of which we ought to keep strict account.\nThese exercises are running, brandishing weights, and jumping, ? high-jumping or broad-jumping, or\nthe kind which I may call, \"the Priest's dance,\" or, in slighting terms, \"the clothes-cleaner's jump.\"\nSelect for practice any one of these, and you will find it plain and easy. But whatever you do, come\nback soon from body to mind. The mind must be exercised both day and night, for it is nourished by\nmoderate labour; and this form of exercise need not be hampered by cold or hot weather, or even\nby old age. Cultivate that good which improves with the years. Of course I do not command you to\nbe always bending over your books and your writing materials; the mind must have a change, ? but\na change of such a kind that it is not unnerved, but merely unbent. Riding in a litter shakes up the\nbody, and does not interfere with study; one may read, dictate, converse, or listen to another; nor\ndoes walking prevent any of these things.", "You need not scorn voice-culture; but I forbid you to practise raising and lowering your voice by\nscales and specific intonations. What if you should next propose to take lessons in walking! If you\nconsult the sort of person whom starvation has taught new tricks, you will have someone to regulate\nyour steps, watch every mouthful as you eat, and go to such lengths as you yourself, by enduring\nhim and believing in him, have encouraged his effrontery to go. \"What, then?\" you will ask; \"is my\nvoice to begin at the outset with shouting and straining the lungs to the utmost?\" No; the natural\nthing is that it be aroused to such a pitch by easy stages, just as persons who are wrangling begin\nwith ordinary conversational tones and then pass to shouting at the top of their lungs. No speaker\ncries \"Help me, citizens!\" at the outset of his speech. Therefore, whenever your spirit's impulse\nprompts you, raise a hubbub, now in louder now in milder tones, according as your voice, as well as\nyour spirit, shall suggest to you, when you are moved to such a performance. Then let your voice,\nwhen you rein it in and call it back to earth, come down gently, not collapse; it should trail off in\ntones half way between high and low, and should not abruptly drop from its raving in the uncouth\nmanner of countrymen. For our purpose is, not to give the voice exercise, but to make it give us\nexercise.", "You see, I have relieved you of no slight bother; and I shall throw in a little complementary present,\n? it is Greek, too. Here is the proverb; it is an excellent one: \"The fool's life is empty of gratitude and\nfull of fears; its course lies wholly toward the future.\" \"Who uttered these words?\" you say. The same\nwriter whom I mentioned before. And what sort of life do you think is meant by the fool's life? That of\nBaba and Isio? No; he means our own, for we are plunged by our blind desires into ventures which\nwill harm us, but certainly will never satisfy us; for if we could be satisfied with anything, we should\nhave been satisfied long ago; nor do we reflect how pleasant it is to demand nothing, how noble it is\nto be contented and not to be dependent upon Fortune. Therefore continually remind yourself,\nLucilius, how many ambitions you have attained. When you see many ahead of you, think how\nmany are behind! If you would thank the gods, and be grateful for your past life, you should\ncontemplate how many men you have outstripped. But what have you to do with the others? You\nhave outstripped yourself.", "Fix a limit which you will not even desire to pass, should you have the power. At last, then, away\nwith all these treacherous goods! They look better to those who hope for them than to those who\nhave attained them. If there were anything substantial in them, they would sooner or later satisfy\nyou; as it is, they merely rouse the drinkers' thirst. Away with fripperies which only serve for show!\nAs to what the future's uncertain lot has in store, why should I demand of Fortune that she give,\nrather than demand of myself that I should not crave? And why should l crave? Shall I heap up my\nwinnings, and forget that man's lot is unsubstantial? For what end should I toil? Lo, to-day is the last;\nif not, it is near the last. Farewell.", "It is clear to you, I am sure, Lucilius, that no man can live a happy life, or even a supportable life,\nwithout the study of wisdom; you know also that a happy life is reached when our wisdom is brought\nto completion, but that life is at least endurable even when our wisdom is only begun. This idea,\nhowever, clear though it is, must be strengthened and implanted more deeply by daily reflection; it is\nmore important for you to keep the resolutions you have already made than to go on and make\nnoble ones. You must persevere, must develop new strength by continuous study, until that which is\nonly a good inclination becomes a good settled purpose. Hence you no longer need to come to me\nwith much talk and protestations; I know that you have made great progress. I understand the\nfeelings which prompt your words; they are not feigned or specious words. Nevertheless I shall tell\nyou what I think, ? that at present I have hopes for you, but not yet perfect trust. And I wish that you\nwould adopt the same attitude towards yourself; there is no reason why you should put confidence\nin yourself too quickly and readily. Examine yourself; scrutinize and observe yourself in divers ways;\nbut mark, before all else, whether it is in philosophy or merely in life itself that you have made\nprogress. Philosophy is no trick to catch the public; it is not devised for show. It is a matter, not of\nwords, but of facts. It is not pursued in order that the day may yield some amusement before it is\nspent, or that our leisure may be relieved of a tedium that irks us. It moulds and constructs the soul;\nit orders our life, guides our conduct, shows us what we should do and what we should leave\nundone; it sits at the helm and directs our course as we waver amid uncertainties. Without it, no one\ncan live fearlessly or in peace of mind. Countless things that happen every hour call for advice; and\nsuch advice is to be sought in philosophy.", "Perhaps someone will say: \"How can philosophy help me, if Fate exists? Of what avail is\nphilosophy, if God rules the universe? Of what avail is it, if Chance governs everything? For not only\nis it impossible to change things that are determined, but it is also impossible to plan beforehand\nagainst what is undetermined; either God has forestalled my plans, and decided what I am to do, or\nelse Fortune gives no free play to my plans.\" Whether the truth, Lucilius, lies in one or in all of these\nviews, we must be philosophers; whether Fate binds us down by an inexorable law, or whether God\nas arbiter of the universe has arranged everything, or whether Chance drives and tosses human\naffairs without method, philosophy ought to be our defence. She will encourage us to obey God\ncheerfully, but Fortune defiantly; she will teach us to follow God and endure Chance. But it is not my\npurpose now to be led into a discussion as to what is within our own control, ? if foreknowledge is\nsupreme, or if a chain of fated events drags us along in its clutches, or if the sudden and the\nunexpected play the tyrant over us; I return now to my warning and my exhortation, that you should\nnot allow the impulse of your spirit to weaken and grow cold. Hold fast to it and establish it firmly, in\norder that what is now impulse may become a habit of the mind.", "If I know you well, you have already been trying to find out, from the very beginning of my letter,\nwhat little contribution it brings to you. Sift the letter, and you will find it. You need not wonder at any\ngenius of mine; for as yet I am lavish only with other men's property. ? But why did I say \"other\nmen\"? Whatever is well said by anyone is mine. ? This also is a saying of Epicurus: \"If you live\naccording to nature, you will never be poor; if you live according to opinion, you will never be rich.\"\nNature's wants are slight; the demands of opinion are boundless. Suppose that the property of many\nmillionaires is heaped up in your possession. Assume that fortune carries you far beyond the limits\nof a private income, decks you with gold, clothes you in purple, and brings you to such a degree of\nluxury and wealth that you can bury the earth under your marble floors; that you may not only\npossess, but tread upon, riches. Add statues, paintings, and whatever any art has devised for the\nsatisfaction of luxury; you will only learn from such things to crave still greater.", "From Rusticus I received the impression that my character required improvement and discipline; and\nfrom him I learned not to be led astray to sophistic emulation, nor to writing on speculative matters,\nnor to delivering little hortatory orations, nor to showing myself off as a man who practises much\ndiscipline, or does benevolent acts in order to make a display; and to abstain from rhetoric, and\npoetry, and fine writing; and not to walk about in the house in my outdoor dress, nor to do other\nthings of the kind; and to write my letters with simplicity, like the letter which Rusticus wrote from\nSinuessa to my mother; and with respect to those who have offended me by words, or done me\nwrong, to be easily disposed to be pacified and reconciled, as soon as they have shown a readiness\nto be reconciled; and to read carefully, and not to be satisfied with a superficial understanding of a\nbook; nor hastily to give my assent to those who talk overmuch; and I am indebted to him for being\nacquainted with the discourses of Epictetus, which he communicated to me out of his own collection.", "That which does not make a man worse than he was, also does not make his life worse, nor does it\nharm him either from without or from within.", "Natural desires are limited; but those which spring from false opinion can have no stopping-point.\nThe false has no limits. When you are travelling on a road, there must be an end; but when astray,\nyour wanderings are limitless. Recall your steps, therefore, from idle things, and when you would\nknow whether that which you seek is based upon a natural or upon a misleading desire, consider\nwhether it can stop at any definite point. If you find, after having travelled far, that there is a more\ndistant goal always in view, you may be sure that this condition is contrary to nature. Farewell.", "Cast away everything of that sort, if you are wise; nay, rather that you may be wise; strive toward a\nsound mind at top speed and with your whole strength. If any bond holds you back, untie it, or sever\nit. \"But,\" you say, \"my estate delays me; I wish to make such disposition of it that it may suffice for\nme when I have nothing to do, lest either poverty be a burden to me, or I myself a burden to others.\"\nYou do not seem, when you say this, to know the strength and power of that good which you are\nconsidering. You do indeed grasp the all-important thing, the great benefit which philosophy confers,\nbut you do not yet discern accurately its various functions, nor do you yet know how great is the help\nwe receive from philosophy in everything, everywhere, ? how, (to use Cicero's language,) it not only\nsuccours us in the greatest matters but also descends to the smallest. Take my advice; call wisdom\ninto consultation; she will advise you not to sit for ever at your ledger. Doubtless, your object, what\nyou wish to attain by such postponement of your studies, is that poverty may not have to be feared\nby you. But what if it is something to be desired? Riches have shut off many a man from the\nattainment of wisdom; poverty is unburdened and free from care. When the trumpet sounds, the\npoor man knows that he is not being attacked; when there is a cry of \"Fire,\" he only seeks a way of\nescape, and does not ask what he can save; if the poor man must go to sea, the harbour does not\nresound, nor do the wharves bustle with the retinue of one individual. No throng of slaves surrounds\nthe poor man, ? slaves for whose mouths the master must covet the fertile crops of regions beyond\nthe sea. It is easy to fill a few stomachs, when they are well trained and crave nothing else but to be\nfilled. Hunger costs but little; squeamishness costs much. Poverty is contented with fulfilling pressing\nneeds.", "Why, then, should you reject Philosophy as a comrade? Even the rich man copies her ways when\nhe is in his senses. If you wish to have leisure for your mind, either be a poor man, or resemble a\npoor man. Study cannot be helpful unless you take pains to live simply; and living simply is voluntary\npoverty. Away, then, with all excuses like: \"I have not yet enough; when I have gained the desired\namount, then I shall devote myself wholly to philosophy.\" And yet this ideal, which you are putting off\nand placing second to other interests, should be secured first of all; you should begin with it. You\nretort: \"I wish to acquire something to live on.\" Yes, but learn while you are acquiring it; for if\nanything forbids you to live nobly, nothing forbids you to die nobly. There is no reason why poverty\nshould call us away from philosophy, ? no, nor even actual want. For when hastening after wisdom,\nwe must endure even hunger. Men have endured hunger when their towns were besieged, and\nwhat other reward for their endurance did they obtain than that they did not fall under the\nconqueror's power? How much greater is the promise of the prize of everlasting liberty, and the\nassurance that we need fear neither God nor man! Even though we starve, we must reach that goal.\nArmies have endured all manner of want, have lived on roots, and have resisted hunger by means\nof food too revolting to mention. All this they have suffered to gain a kingdom, and, ? what is more\nmarvellous, ? to gain a kingdom that will be another's. Will any man hesitate to endure poverty, in\norder that he may free his mind from madness?", "Therefore one should not seek to lay up riches first; one may attain to philosophy, however, even\nwithout money for the journey. It is indeed so. After you have come to possess all other things, shall\nyou then wish to possess wisdom also? Is philosophy to be the last requisite in life, ? a sort of\nsupplement? Nay, your plan should be this: be a philosopher now, whether you have anything or\nnot, ? for if you have anything, how do you know that you have not too much already? ? but if you\nhave nothing, seek understanding first, before anything else. \"But,\" you say, \"I shall lack the\nnecessities of life.\" In the first place, you cannot lack them; because nature demands but little, and\nthe wise man suits his needs to nature. But if the utmost pinch of need arrives, he will quickly take\nleave of life and cease being a trouble to himself. If, however, his means of existence are meagre\nand scanty, he will make the best of them, without being anxious or worried about anything more\nthan the bare necessities; he will do justice to his belly and his shoulders; with free and happy spirit\nhe will laugh at the bustling of rich men, and the flurried ways of those who are hastening after\nwealth, and say: \"Why of your own accord postpone your real life to the distant future? Shall you\nwait for some interest to fall due, or for some income on your merchandise, or for a place in the will\nof some wealthy old man, when you can be rich here and now. Wisdom offers wealth in ready\nmoney, and pays it over to those in whose eyes she has made wealth superfluous.\" These remarks\nrefer to other men; you are nearer the rich class. Change the age in which you live, and you have\ntoo much. But in every age, what is enough remains the same.", "I might close my letter at this point, if I had not got you into bad habits. One cannot greet Parthian\nroyalty without bringing a gift; and in your case I cannot say farewell without paying a price. But what\nof it? I shall borrow from Epicurus: \"The acquisition of riches has been for many men, not an end,\nbut a change, of troubles.\" I do not wonder. For the fault is not in the wealth, but in the mind itself.\nThat which had made poverty a burden to us, has made riches also a burden. Just as it matters little\nwhether you lay a sick man on a wooden or on a golden bed, for whithersoever he be moved he will\ncarry his malady with him; so one need not care whether the diseased mind is bestowed upon riches\nor upon poverty. His malady goes with the man. Farewell.", "It is the month of December, and yet the city is at this very moment in a sweat. Licence is given to\nthe general merrymaking. Everything resounds with mighty preparations, ? as if the Saturnalia\ndiffered at all from the usual business day! So true it is that the difference is nil, that I regard as\ncorrect the remark of the man who said: \"Once December was a month; now it is a year.\"", "If I had you with me, I should be glad to consult you and find out what you think should be done, ?\nwhether we ought to make no change in our daily routine, or whether, in order not to be out of\nsympathy with the ways of the public, we should dine in gayer fashion and doff the toga. As it is\nnow, we Romans have changed our dress for the sake of pleasure and holiday-making, though in\nformer times that was only customary when the State was disturbed and had fallen on evil days. I\nam sure that, if I know you aright, playing the part of an umpire you would have wished that we\nshould be neither like the liberty-capped throng in all ways, nor in all ways unlike them; unless,\nperhaps, this is just the season when we ought to lay down the law to the soul, and bid it be alone in\nrefraining from pleasures just when the whole mob has let itself go in pleasures; for this is the surest\nproof which a man can get of his own constancy, if he neither seeks the things which are seductive\nand allure him to luxury, nor is led into them. It shows much more courage to remain dry and sober\nwhen the mob is drunk and vomiting; but it shows greater self-control to refuse to withdraw oneself\nand to do what the crowd does, but in a different way, ? thus neither making oneself conspicuous\nnor becoming one of the crowd. For one may keep holiday without extravagance.", "I am so firmly determined, however, to test the constancy of your mind that, drawing from the\nteachings of great men, I shall give you also a lesson: Set aside a certain number of days, during\nwhich you shall be content with the scantiest and cheapest fare, with coarse and rough dress,\nsaying to yourself the while: \"Is this the condition that I feared?\" It is precisely in times of immunity\nfrom care that the soul should toughen itself beforehand for occasions of greater stress, and it is\nwhile Fortune is kind that it should fortify itself against her violence. In days of peace the soldier\nperforms man?uvres, throws up earthworks with no enemy in sight, and wearies himself by\ngratuitous toil, in order that he may be equal to unavoidable toil. If you would not have a man flinch\nwhen the crisis comes, train him before it comes. Such is the course which those men have followed\nwho, in their imitation of poverty, have every month come almost to want, that they might never\nrecoil from what they had so often rehearsed.", "You need not suppose that I mean meals like Timon's, or \"paupers' huts,\" or any other device which\nluxurious millionaires use to beguile the tedium of their lives. Let the pallet be a real one, and the\ncoarse cloak; let the bread be hard and grimy. Endure all this for three or four days at a time,\nsometimes for more, so that it may be a test of yourself instead of a mere hobby. Then, I assure\nyou, my dear Lucilius, you will leap for joy when filled with a pennyworth of food, and you will\nunderstand that a man's peace of mind does not depend upon Fortune; for, even when angry she\ngrants enough for our needs.", "There is no reason, however, why you should think that you are doing anything great; for you will\nmerely be doing what many thousands of slaves and many thousands of poor men are doing every\nday. But you may credit yourself with this item, ? that you will not be doing it under compulsion, and\nthat it will be as easy for you to endure it permanently as to make the experiment from time to time.\nLet us practise our strokes on the \"dummy\"; let us become intimate with poverty, so that Fortune\nmay not catch us off our guard. We shall be rich with all the more comfort, if we once learn how far\npoverty is from being a burden.", "The nature of that which is universally useful has been compelled to do this.", "Even Epicurus, the teacher of pleasure, used to observe stated intervals, during which he satisfied\nhis hunger in niggardly fashion; he wished to see whether he thereby fell short of full and complete\nhappiness, and, if so, by what amount he fell short, and whether this amount was worth purchasing\nat the price of great effort. At any rate, he makes such a statement in the well known letter written to\nPolyaenus in the archonship of Charinus. Indeed, he boasts that he himself lived on less than a\npenny, but that Metrodorus, whose progress was not yet so great, needed a whole penny. Do you\nthink that there can be fulness on such fare? Yes, and there is pleasure also, ? not that shifty and\nfleeting pleasure which needs a fillip now and then, but a pleasure that is steadfast and sure. For\nthough water, barley-meal, and crusts of barley-bread, are not a cheerful diet, yet it is the highest\nkind of pleasure to be able to derive pleasure from this sort of food, and to have reduced one's\nneeds to that modicum which no unfairness of Fortune can snatch away. Even prison fare is more\ngenerous; and those who have been set apart for capital punishment are not so meanly fed by the\nman who is to execute them. Therefore, what a noble soul must one have, to descend of one's own\nfree will to a diet which even those who have been sentenced to death have not to fear! This is\nindeed forestalling the spear-thrusts of Fortune.", "So begin, my dear Lucilius, to follow the custom of these men, and set apart certain days on which\nyou shall withdraw from your business and make yourself at home with the scantiest fare. Establish\nbusiness relations with poverty.", "Dare, O my friend, to scorn the sight of wealth,\nAnd mould thyself to kinship with thy God.", "For he alone is in kinship with God who has scorned wealth. Of course I do not forbid you to\npossess it, but I would have you reach the point at which you possess it dauntlessly; this can be\naccomplished only by persuading yourself that you can live happily without it as well as with it, and\nby regarding riches always as likely to elude you.", "But now I must begin to fold up my letter. \"Settle your debts first,\" you cry. Here is a draft on\nEpicurus; he will pay down the sum: \"Ungoverned anger begets madness.\" You cannot help\nknowing the truth of these words, since you have had not only slaves, but also enemies. But indeed\nthis emotion blazes out against all sorts of persons; it springs from love as much as from hate, and\nshows\nitself not less in serious matters than in jest and sport. And it makes no difference how important the\nprovocation may be, but into what kind of soul it penetrates. Similarly with fire; it does not matter\nhow great is the flame, but what it falls upon. For solid timbers have repelled a very great fire;\nconversely, dry and easily inflammable stuff nourishes the slightest spark into a conflagration. So it\nis with anger, my dear Lucilius; the outcome of a mighty anger is madness, and hence anger should\nbe avoided, not merely that we may escape excess, but that we may have a healthy mind. Farewell.", "I leap for joy whenever I receive letters from you. For they fill me with hope; they are now not mere\nassurances concerning you, but guarantees. And I beg and pray you to proceed in this course; for\nwhat better request could I make of a friend than one which is to be made for his own sake? If\npossible, withdraw yourself from all the business of which you speak; and if you cannot do this, tear\nyourself away. We have dissipated enough of our time already; let us in old age begin to pack up\nour baggage. Surely there is nothing in this that men can begrudge us. We have spent our lives on\nthe high seas; let us die in harbour. Not that I would advise you to try to win fame by your retirement;\none's retirement should neither be paraded nor concealed. Not concealed, I say, for I shall not go so\nfar in urging you as to expect you to condemn all men as mad and then seek out for yourself a\nhiding-place and oblivion; rather make this your business, that your retirement be not conspicuous,\nthough it should be obvious. In the second place, while those whose choice is unhampered from the\nstart will deliberate on that other question, whether they wish to pass their lives in obscurity, in your\ncase there is not a free choice. Your ability and energy have thrust you into the work of the world; so\nhave the charm of your writings and the friendships you have made with famous and notable men.\nRenown has already taken you by storm. You may sink yourself into the depths of obscurity and\nutterly hide yourself; yet your earlier acts will reveal you. You cannot keep lurking in the dark; much\nof the old gleam will follow you wherever you fly.", "Peace you can claim for yourself without being disliked by anyone, without any sense of loss, and\nwithout any pangs of spirit. For what will you leave behind you that you can imagine yourself\nreluctant to leave? Your clients? But none of these men courts you for yourself; they merely court\nsomething from you. People used to hunt friends, but now they hunt pelf; if a lonely old man\nchanges his will, the morning-caller transfers himself to another door. Great things cannot be bought\nfor small sums; so reckon up whether it is preferable to leave your own true self, or merely some of\nyour belongings. Would that you had had the privilege of growing old amid the limited circumstances\nof your origin, and that fortune had not raised you to such heights! You were removed far from the\nsight of wholesome living by your swift rise to prosperity, by your province, by your position as\nprocurator, and by all that such things promise; you will next acquire more important duties and after\nthem still more. And what will be the result? Why wait until there is nothing left for you to crave? That\ntime will never come. We hold that there is a succession of causes, from which fate is woven;\nsimilarly, you may be sure, there is a succession in our desires; for one begins where its\npredecessor ends. You have been thrust into an existence which will never of itself put an end to\nyour wretchedness and your slavery. Withdraw your chafed neck from the yoke; it is better that it\nshould be cut off once for all, than galled for ever. If you retreat to privacy, everything will be on a\nsmaller scale, but you will be satisfied abundantly; in your present condition, however, there is no\nsatisfaction in the plenty which is heaped upon you on all sides. Would you rather be poor and\nsated, or rich and hungry? Prosperity is not only greedy, but it also lies exposed to the greed of\nothers. And as long as nothing satisfies you, you yourself cannot satisfy others.", "\"But,\" you say, \"how can I take my leave?\" Any way you please. Reflect how many hazards you\nhave ventured for the sake of money, and how much toil you have undertaken for a title! You must\ndare something to gain leisure, also, ? or else grow old amid the worries of procuratorships abroad\nand subsequently of civil duties at home, living in turmoil and in ever fresh floods of responsibilities,\nwhich no man has ever succeeded in avoiding by unobtrusiveness or by seclusion of life. For what\nbearing on the case has your personal desire for a secluded life? Your position in the world desires\nthe opposite! What if, even now, you allow that position to grow greater? But all that is added to your\nsuccesses will be added to your fears. At this point I should like to quote a saying of Maecenas, who\nspoke the truth when he stood on the very summit: \"There's thunder even on the loftiest peaks.\" If\nyou ask me in what book these words are found, they occur in the volume entitled Prometheus. He\nsimply meant to say that these lofty peaks have their tops surrounded with thunder-storms. But is\nany power worth so high a price that a man like you would ever, in order to obtain it, adopt a style so\ndebauched as that? Maecenas was indeed a man of parts, who would have left a great pattern for\nRoman oratory to follow, had his good fortune not made him effeminate, ? nay, had it not\nemasculated him! An end like his awaits you also, unless you forthwith shorten sail and, ? as\nMaecenas was not willing to do until it was too late, ? hug the shore!", "This saying of Maecenas's might have squared my account with you; but I feel sure, knowing you,\nthat you will get out an injunction against me, and that you will be unwilling to accept payment of my\ndebt in such crude and debased currency. However that may be, I shall draw on the account of\nEpicurus. He says: \"You must reflect carefully beforehand with whom you are to eat and drink,\nrather than what you are to eat and drink. For a dinner of meats without the company of a friend is\nlike the life of a lion or a wolf.\" This privilege will not be yours unless you withdraw from the world;\notherwise, you will have as guests only those whom your slave-secretary sorts out from the throng\nof callers. It is, however, a mistake to select your friend in the reception-hall or to test him at the\ndinner-table. The most serious misfortune for a busy man who is overwhelmed by his possessions\nis, that he believes men to be his friends when he himself is not a friend to them, and that he deems\nhis favours to be effective in winning friends, although, in the case of certain men, the more they\nowe, the more they hate. A trifling debt makes a man your debtor; a large one makes him an enemy.\n\"What,\" you say, \"do not kindnesses establish friendships?\" They do, if one has had the privilege of\nchoosing those who are to receive them, and if they are placed judiciously, instead of being\nscattered broadcast.", "Therefore, while you are beginning to call your mind your own, meantime apply this maxim of the\nwise: consider that it is more important who receives a thing, than what it is he receives. Farewell.", "Consider that everything which happens, happens justly, and if thou observest carefully, thou wilt\nfind it to be so. I do not say only with respect to the continuity of the series of things, but with respect\nto what is just, and as if it were done by one who assigns to each thing its value. Observe then as\nthou hast begun; and whatever thou doest, do it in conjunction with this, the being good, and in the\nsense in which a man is properly understood to be good. Keep to this in every action.", "If you are in good health and if you think yourself worthy of becoming at last your own master, I am\nglad. For the credit will be mine, if I can drag you from the floods in which you are being buffeted\nwithout hope of emerging. This, however, my dear Lucilius, I ask and beg of you, on your part, that\nyou let wisdom sink into your soul, and test your progress, not by mere speech or writings, but by\nstoutness of heart and decrease of desire. Prove your words by your deeds.", "Far different is the purpose of those who are speech-making and trying to win the approbation of a\nthrong of hearers, far different that of those who allure the ears of young men and idlers by\nmany-sided or fluent argumentation; philosophy teaches us to act, not to speak; it exacts of every\nman that he should live according to his own standards, that his life should not be out of harmony\nwith his words, and that, further, his inner life should be of one hue and not out of harmony with all\nhis activities. This, I say, is the highest duty and the highest proof of wisdom, ? that deed and word\nshould be in accord, that a man should be equal to himself under all conditions, and always the\nsame.", "\"But,\" you reply, \"who can maintain this standard?\" Very few, to be sure; but there are some. It is\nindeed a hard undertaking, and I do not say that the philosopher can always keep the same pace.\nBut he can always travel the same path. Observe yourself, then, and see whether your dress and\nyour house are inconsistent, whether you treat yourself lavishly and your family meanly, whether you\neat frugal dinners and yet build luxurious houses. You should lay hold, once for all, upon a single\nnorm to live by, and should regulate your whole life according to this norm. Some men restrict\nthemselves at home, but strut with swelling port before the public; such discordance is a fault, and it\nindicates a wavering mind which cannot yet keep its balance. And I can tell you, further, whence\narise this unsteadiness and disagreement of action and purpose; it is because no man resolves\nupon what he wishes, and, even if he has done so, he does not persist in it, but jumps the track; not\nonly does he change, but he returns and slips back to the conduct which he has abandoned and\nabjured. Therefore, to omit the ancient definitions of wisdom and to include the whole manner of\nhuman life, I can be satisfied with the following: \"What is wisdom? Always desiring the same things,\nand always refusing the same things.\" You may be excused from adding the little proviso, ? that\nwhat you wish, should be right; since no man can always be satisfied with the same thing, unless it\nis right.", "For this reason men do not know what they wish, except at the actual moment of wishing; no man\never decided once and for all to desire or to refuse. Judgment varies from day to day, and changes\nto the opposite, making many a man pass his life in a kind of game. Press on, therefore, as you\nhave begun; perhaps you will be led to perfection, or to a point which you alone understand is still\nshort of perfection.", "\"But what,\" you say, \"will become of my crowded household without a household income?\" If you\nstop supporting that crowd, it will support itself; or perhaps you will learn by the bounty of poverty\nwhat you cannot learn by your own bounty. Poverty will keep for you your true and tried friends; you\nwill be rid of the men who were not seeking you for yourself, but for something which you have. Is it\nnot true, however, that you should love poverty, if only for this single reason, ? that it will show you\nthose by whom you are loved? O when will that time come, when no one shall tell lies to compliment\nyou! Accordingly, let your thoughts, your efforts, your desires, help to make you content with your\nown self and with the goods that spring from yourself; and commit all your other prayers to God's\nkeeping! What happiness could come closer home to you? Bring yourself down to humble\nconditions, from which you cannot be ejected; and in order that you may do so with greater alacrity,\nthe contribution contained in this letter shall refer to that subject; I shall bestow it upon you forthwith.", "Although you may look askance, Epicurus will once again be glad to settle my indebtedness:\n\"Believe me, your words will be more imposing if you sleep on a cot and wear rags. For in that case\nyou will not be merely saying them; you will be demonstrating their truth.\" I, at any rate, listen in a\ndifferent spirit to the utterances of our friend Demetrius, after I have seen him reclining without even\na cloak to cover him, and, more than this, without rugs to lie upon. He is not only a teacher of the\ntruth, but a witness to the truth. \"May not a man, however, despise wealth when it lies in his very\npocket?\" Of course; he also is great-souled, who sees riches heaped up round him and, after\nwondering long and deeply because they have come into his possession, smiles, and hears rather\nthan feels that they are his. It means much not to be spoiled by intimacy with riches; and he is truly\ngreat who is poor amidst riches. \"Yes, but I do not know,\" you say, \"how the man you speak of will\nendure poverty, if he falls into it suddenly.\" Nor do I, Epicurus, know whether the poor man you\nspeak of will despise riches, should he suddenly fall into them; accordingly, in the case of both, it is\nthe mind that must be appraised, and we must investigate whether your man is pleased with his\npoverty, and whether my man is displeased with his riches. Otherwise, the cot-bed and the rags are\nslight proof of his good intentions, if it has not been made clear that the person concerned endures\nthese trials not from necessity but from preference.", "It is the mark, however, of a noble spirit not to precipitate oneself into such things on the ground that\nthey are better, but to practise for them on the ground that they are thus easy to endure. And they\nare easy to endure, Lucilius; when, however, you come to them after long rehearsal, they are even\npleasant; for they contain a sense of freedom from care, ? and without this nothing is pleasant. I\nhold it essential, therefore, to do as I have told you in a letter that great men have often done: to\nreserve a few days in which we may prepare ourselves for real poverty by means of fancied poverty.\nThere is all the more reason for doing this, because we have been steeped in luxury and regard all\nduties as hard and onerous. Rather let the soul be roused from its sleep and be prodded, and let it\nbe reminded that nature has prescribed very little for us. No man is born rich. Every man, when he\nfirst sees light, is commanded to be content with milk and rags. Such is our beginning, and yet\nkingdoms are all too small for us! Farewell.", "Do you conclude that you are having difficulties with those men about whom you wrote to me? Your\ngreatest difficulty is with yourself; for you are your own stumbling-block. You do not know what you\nwant. You are better at approving the right course than at following it out. You see where the true\nhappiness lies, but you have not the courage to attain it. Let me tell you what it is that hinders you,\ninasmuch as you do not of yourself discern it.", "You think that this condition, which you are to abandon, is one of importance, and after resolving\nupon that ideal state of calm into which you hope to pass, you are held back by the lustre of your\npresent life, from which it is your intention to depart, just as if you were about to fall into a state of\nfilth and darkness. This is a mistake, Lucilius; to go from your present life into the other is a\npromotion. There is the same difference between these two lives as there is between mere\nbrightness and real light; the latter has a definite source within itself, the other borrows its radiance;\nthe one is called forth by an illumination coming from the outside, and anyone who stands between\nthe source and the object immediately turns the latter into a dense shadow; but the other has a glow\nthat comes from within.", "It is your own studies that will make you shine and will render you eminent. Allow me to mention the\ncase of Epicurus. He was writing to Idomeneus and trying to recall him from a showy existence to\nsure and steadfast renown. Idomeneus was at that time a minister of state who exercised a rigorous\nauthority and had important affairs in hand. \"If,\" said Epicurus, \"you are attracted by fame, my letters\nwill make you more renowned than all the things which you cherish and which make you cherished.\"\nDid Epicurus speak falsely? Who would have known of Idomeneus, had not the philosopher thus\nengraved his name in those letters of his? All the grandees and satraps, even the king himself, who\nwas petitioned for the title which Idomeneus sought, are sunk in deep oblivion. Cicero's letters keep\nthe name of Atticus from perishing. It would have profited Atticus nothing to have an Agrippa for a\nson-in-law, a Tiberius for the husband of his grand-daughter, and a Drusus Caesar for a\ngreat-grandson; amid these mighty names his name would never be spoken, had not Cicero bound\nhim to himself. The deep flood of time will roll over us; some few great men will raise their heads\nabove it, and, though destined at the last to depart into the same realms of silence, will battle\nagainst oblivion and maintain their ground for long.", "Do not have such an opinion of things as he has who does thee wrong, or such as he wishes thee to\nhave, but look at them as they are in truth.", "That which Epicurus could promise his friend, this I promise you, Lucilius. I shall find favour among\nlater generations; I can take with me names that will endure as long as mine. Our poet Vergil\npromised an eternal name to two heroes, and is keeping his promise:", "Blest heroes twain! If power my song possess,\nThe record of your names shall never be\nErased from out the book of Time, while yet\nAeneas' tribe shall keep the Capitol,\nThat rock immovable, and Roman sire\nShall empire hold.", "Whenever men have been thrust forward by fortune, whenever they have become part and parcel of\nanother's influence, they have found abundant favour, their houses have been thronged, only so\nlong as they themselves have kept their position; when they themselves have left it, they have\nslipped at once from the memory of men. But in the case of innate ability, the respect in which it is\nheld increases, and not only does honour accrue to the man himself, but whatever has attached\nitself to his memory is passed on from one to another.", "In order that Idomeneus may not be introduced free of charge into my letter, he shall make up the\nindebtedness from his own account. It was to him that Epicurus addressed the well-known saying\nurging him to make Pythocles rich, but not rich in the vulgar and equivocal way. \"If you wish,\" said\nhe, \"to make Pythocles rich, do not add to his store of money, but subtract from his desires.\" This\nidea is too clear to need explanation, and too clever to need reinforcement. There is, however, one\npoint on which I would warn you, ? not to consider that this statement applies only to riches; its\nvalue will be the same, no matter how you apply it. \"If you wish to make Pythocles honourable, do\nnot add to his honours, but subtract from his desires\"; \"if you wish Pythocles to have pleasure for\never, do not add to his pleasures, but subtract from his desires\"; \"if you wish to make Pythocles an\nold man, filling his life to the full, do not add to his years, but subtract from his desires.\" There is no\nreason why you should hold that these words belong to Epicurus alone; they are public property. I\nthink we ought to do in philosophy as they are wont to do in the Senate: when someone has made a\nmotion, of which I approve to a certain extent, I ask him to make his motion in two parts, and I vote\nfor the part which I approve. So I am all the more glad to repeat the distinguished words of Epicurus,\nin order that I may prove to those who have recourse to him through a bad motive, thinking that they\nwill have in him a screen for their own vices, that they must live honourably, no matter what school\nthey follow.", "Go to his Garden and read the motto carved there: \"Stranger, here you will do well to tarry; here our\nhighest good is pleasure.\" The care-taker of that abode, a kindly host, will be ready for you; he will\nwelcome you with barley-meal and serve you water also in abundance, with these words: \"Have you\nnot been well entertained?\" \"This garden,\" he says, \"does not whet your appetite; it quenches it. Nor\ndoes it make you more thirsty with every drink; it slakes the thirst by a natural cure, ? a cure that\ndemands no fee. This is the 'pleasure' in which I have grown old.\"", "In speaking with you, however, I refer to those desires which refuse alleviation, which must be\nbribed to cease. For in regard to the exceptional desires, which may be postponed, which may be\nchastened and checked, I have this one thought to share with you: a pleasure of that sort is\naccording to our nature, but it is not according to our needs; one owes nothing to it; whatever is\nexpended upon it is a free gift. The belly will not listen to advice; it makes demands, it importunes.\nAnd yet it is not a troublesome creditor; you can send it away at small cost, provided only that you\ngive it what you owe, not merely all you are able to give. Farewell.", "You understand by this time that you must withdraw yourself from those showy and depraved\npursuits; but you still wish to know how this may be accomplished. There are certain things which\ncan be pointed out only by someone who is present. The physician cannot prescribe by letter the\nproper time for eating or bathing; he must feel the pulse. There is an old adage about gladiators, ?\nthat they plan their fight in the ring; as they intently watch, something in the adversary's glance,\nsome movement of his hand, even some slight bending of his body, gives a warning. We can\nformulate general rules and commit them to writing, as to what is usually done, or ought to be done;\nsuch advice may be given, not only to our absent friends, but also to succeeding generations. In\nregard, however, to that second question, ? when or how your plan is to be carried out, ? no one will\nadvise at long range; we must take counsel in the presence of the actual situation. You must be not\nonly present in the body, but watchful in mind, if you would avail yourself of the fleeting opportunity.\nAccordingly, look about you for the opportunity; if you see it, grasp it, and with all your energy and\nwith all your strength devote yourself to this task, ? to rid yourself of those business duties.", "Now listen carefully to the opinion which I shall offer; it is my opinion that you should withdraw either\nfrom that kind of existence, or else from existence altogether. But I likewise maintain that you should\ntake a gentle path, that you may loosen rather than cut the knot which you have bungled so badly in\ntying, ? provided that if there shall be no other way of loosening it, you may actually cut it. No man is\nso faint-hearted that he would rather hang in suspense for ever than drop once for all. Meanwhile, ?\nand this is of first importance, ? do not hamper yourself; be content with the business into which you\nhave lowered yourself, or, as you prefer to have people think, have tumbled. There is no reason why\nyou should be struggling on to something further; if you do, you will lose all grounds of excuse, and\nmen will see that it was not a tumble. The usual explanation which men offer is wrong: \"I was\ncompelled to do it. Suppose it was against my will; I had to do it.\" But no one is compelled to pursue\nprosperity at top speed; it means something to call a halt, ? even if one does not offer resistance, ?\ninstead of pressing eagerly after favouring fortune. Shall you then be put out with me, if I not only\ncome to advise you, but also call in others to advise you, ? wiser heads than my own, men before\nwhom I am wont to lay any problem upon\nwhich I am pondering? Read the letter of Epicurus which bears on this matter; it is addressed to\nIdomeneus. The writer asks him to hasten as fast as he can, and beat a retreat before some\nstronger influence comes between and takes from him the liberty to withdraw. But he also adds that\none should attempt nothing except at the time when it can be attempted suitably and seasonably.\nThen, when the long-sought occasion comes, let him be up and doing. Epicurus forbids us to doze\nwhen we are meditating escape; he bids us hope for a safe release from even the hardest trials,\nprovided that we are not in too great a hurry before the time, nor too dilatory when the time arrives.", "Now, I suppose, you are looking for a Stoic motto also. There is really no reason why anyone should\nslander that school to you on the ground of its rashness; as a matter of fact, its caution is greater\nthan its courage. You are perhaps expecting the sect to utter such words as these: \"It is base to\nflinch under a burden. Wrestle with the duties which you have once undertaken. No man is brave\nand earnest if he avoids danger, if his spirit does not grow with the very difficulty of his task.\" Words\nlike these will indeed be spoken to you, if only your perseverance shall have an object that is worth\nwhile, if only you will not have to do or to suffer anything unworthy of a good man; besides, a good\nman will not waste himself upon mean and discreditable work or be busy merely for the sake of\nbeing busy. Neither will he, as you imagine, become so involved in ambitious schemes that he will\nhave continually to endure their ebb and flow. Nay, when he sees the dangers, uncertainties, and\nhazards in which he was formerly tossed about, he will withdraw, ? not turning his back to the foe,\nbut falling back little by little to a safe position. From business, however, my dear Lucilius, it is easy\nto escape, if only you will despise the rewards of business. We are held back and kept from\nescaping by thoughts like these: \"What then? Shall I leave behind me these great prospects? Shall I\ndepart at the very time of harvest? Shall I have no slaves at my side? no retinue for my litter? no\ncrowd in my reception-room?\"", "Hence men leave such advantages as these with reluctance; they love the reward of their\nhardships, but curse the hardships themselves. Men complain about their ambitions as they\ncomplain about their mistresses; in other words, if you penetrate their real feelings, you will find, not\nhatred, but bickering. Search the minds of those who cry down what they have desired, who talk\nabout escaping from things which they are unable to do without; you will comprehend that they are\nlingering of their own free will in a situation which they declare they find it hard and wretched to\nendure. It is so, my dear Lucilius; there are a few men whom slavery holds fast, but there are many\nmore who hold fast to slavery.", "A man should always have these two rules in readiness; the one, to do only whatever the reason of\nthe ruling and legislating faculty may suggest for the use of men; the other, to change thy opinion, if\nthere is any one at hand who sets thee right and moves thee from any opinion. But this change of\nopinion must proceed only from a certain persuasion, as of what is just or of common advantage,\nand the like, not because it appears pleasant or brings reputation.", "If, however, you intend to be rid of this slavery; if freedom is genuinely pleasing in your eyes; and if\nyou seek counsel for this one purpose, ? that you may have the good fortune to accomplish this\npurpose without perpetual annoyance, ? how can the whole company of Stoic thinkers fail to\napprove your course? Zeno, Chrysippus, and all their kind will give you advice that is temperate,\nhonourable, and suitable. But if you keep turning round and looking about, in order to see how much\nyou may carry away with you, and how much money you may keep to equip yourself for the life of\nleisure, you will never find a way out. No man can swim ashore and take his baggage with him. Rise\nto a higher life, with the favour of the gods; but let it not be favour of such a kind as the gods give to\nmen when with kind and genial faces they bestow magnificent ills, justified in so doing by the one\nfact that the things which irritate and torture have been bestowed in answer to prayer.", "I was just putting the seal upon this letter; but it must be broken again, in order that it may go to you\nwith its customary contribution, bearing with it some noble word. And lo, here is one that occurs to\nmy mind; I do not know whether its truth or its nobility of utterance is the greater. \"Spoken by\nwhom?\" you ask. By Epicurus; for I am still appropriating other men's belongings. The words are:\n\"Everyone goes out of life just as if he had but lately entered it.\" Take anyone off his guard, ? young,\nold, or middle-aged; you will find that all are equally afraid of death, and equally ignorant of life. No\none has anything finished, because we have kept putting off into the future all our undertakings. No\nthought in the quotation given above pleases me more than that it taunts old men with being infants.\n\"No one,\" he says, \"leaves this world in a different manner from one who has just been born.\" That\nis not true; for we are worse when we die than when we were born; but it is our fault, and not that of\nNature. Nature should scold us, saying: \"What does this mean? I brought you into the world without\ndesires or fears, free from superstition, treachery and the other curses. Go forth as you were when\nyou entered!\"", "A man has caught the message of wisdom, if he can die as free from care as he was at birth; but as\nit is, we are all a-flutter at the approach of the dreaded end. Our courage fails us, our cheeks blanch;\nour tears fall, though they are unavailing. But what is baser than to fret at the very threshold of\npeace? The reason, however, is, that we are stripped of all our goods, we have jettisoned our cargo\nof life and are in distress; for no part of it has been packed in the hold; it has all been heaved\noverboard and has drifted away. Men do not care how nobly they live, but only how long, although it\nis within the reach of every man to live nobly, but within no man's power to live long. Farewell.", "Do you suppose that I shall write you how kindly the winter season has dealt with us, ? a short\nseason and a mild one, ? or what a nasty spring we are having, ? cold weather out of season, ? and\nall the other trivialities which people write when they are at a loss for topics of conversation? No; I\nshall communicate something which may help both you and myself. And what shall this \"something\"\nbe, if not an exhortation to soundness of mind? Do you ask what is the foundation of a sound mind?\nIt is, not to find joy in useless things. I said that it was the foundation; it is really the pinnacle. We\nhave reached the heights if we know what it is that we find joy in and if we have not placed our\nhappiness in the control of externals. The man who is goaded ahead by hope of anything, though it\nbe within reach, though it be easy of access, and though his ambitions have never played him false,\nis troubled and unsure of himself. Above all, my dear Lucilius, make this your business: learn how to\nfeel joy.", "Do you think that I am now robbing you of many pleasures when I try to do away with the gifts of\nchance, when I counsel the avoidance of hope, the sweetest thing that gladdens our hearts? Quite\nthe contrary; I do not wish you ever to be deprived of gladness. I would have it born in your house;\nand it is born there, if only it be inside of you. Other objects of cheer do not fill a man's bosom; they\nmerely smooth his brow and are inconstant, ? unless perhaps you believe that he who laughs has\njoy. The very soul must be happy and confident, lifted above every circumstance.", "Real joy, believe me, is a stern matter. Can one, do you think, despise death with a care-free\ncountenance, or with a \"blithe and gay\" expression, as our young dandies are accustomed to say?\nOr can one thus open his door to poverty, or hold the curb on his pleasures, or contemplate the\nendurance of pain? He who ponders these things in his heart is indeed full of joy; but it is not a\ncheerful joy. It is just this joy, however, of which I would have you become the owner; for it will never\nfail you when once you have found its source. The yield of poor mines is on the surface; those are\nreally rich whose veins lurk deep, and they will make more bountiful returns to him who delves\nunceasingly. So too those baubles which delight the common crowd afford but a thin pleasure, laid\non as a coating, and every joy that is only plated lacks a real basis. But the joy of which I speak, that\nto which I am endeavouring to lead you, is something solid, disclosing itself the more fully as you\npenetrate into it. Therefore I pray you, my dearest Lucilius, do the one thing that can render you\nreally happy: cast aside and trample under foot all those things that glitter outwardly and are held\nout to you by another or as obtainable from another; look toward the true good, and rejoice only in\nthat which comes from your own store. And what do I mean by \"from your own store\"? I mean from\nyour very self, that which is the best part of you. The frail body, also, even though we can\naccomplish nothing without it, is to be regarded as necessary rather than as important; it involves us\nin vain pleasures, short-lived, and soon to be regretted, which, unless they are reined in by extreme\nself-control, will be transformed into the opposite. This is what I mean: pleasure, unless it has been\nkept within bounds, tends to rush headlong into the abyss of sorrow.", "But it is hard to keep within bounds in that which you believe to be good. The real good may be\ncoveted with safety. Do you ask me what this real good is, and whence it derives? I will tell you: it\ncomes from a good conscience, from honourable purposes, from right actions, from contempt of the\ngifts of chance, from an even and calm way of living which treads but one path. For men who leap\nfrom one purpose to another, or do not even leap but are carried over by a sort of hazard, ? how can\nsuch wavering and unstable persons possess any good that is fixed and lasting? There are only a\nfew who control themselves and their affairs by a guiding purpose; the rest do not proceed; they are\nmerely swept along, like objects afloat in a river. And of these objects, some are held back by\nsluggish waters and are transported gently; others are torn along by a more violent current; some,\nwhich are nearest the bank, are left there as the current slackens; and others are carried out to sea\nby the onrush of the stream. Therefore, we should decide what we wish, and abide by the decision.", "Now is the time for me to pay my debt. I can give you a saying of your friend Epicurus and thus clear\nthis letter of its obligation: \"It is bothersome always to be beginning life.\" Or another, which will\nperhaps express the meaning better: \"They live ill who are always beginning to live.\" You are right in\nasking why; the saying certainly stands in need of a commentary. It is because the life of such\npersons is always incomplete. But a man cannot stand prepared for the approach of death if he has\njust begun to live. We must make it our aim already to have lived long enough. No one deems that\nhe has done so, if he is just on the point of planning his life. You need not think that there are few of\nthis kind; practically everyone is of such a stamp. Some men, indeed, only begin to live when it is\ntime for them to leave off living. And if this seems surprising to you, I shall add that which will\nsurprise you still more: Some men have left off living before they have begun. Farewell.", "You write me that you are anxious about the result of a lawsuit, with which an angry opponent is\nthreatening you; and you expect me to advise you to picture to yourself a happier issue, and to rest\nin the allurements of hope. Why, indeed, is it necessary to summon trouble, ? which must be\nendured soon enough when it has once arrived, ? or to anticipate trouble and ruin the present\nthrough fear of the future? It is indeed foolish to be unhappy now because you may be unhappy at\nsome future time. But I shall conduct you to peace of mind by another route: if you would put off all\nworry, assume that what you fear may happen will certainly happen in any event; whatever the\ntrouble may be, measure it in your own mind, and estimate the amount of your fear. You will thus\nunderstand that what you fear is either insignificant or short-lived. And you need not spend a long\ntime in gathering illustrations which will strengthen you; every epoch has produced them. Let your\nthoughts travel into any era of Roman or foreign history, and there will throng before you notable\nexamples of high achievement or of high endeavour.", "If you lose this case, can anything more severe happen to you than being sent into exile or led to\nprison? Is there a worse fate that any man may fear than being burned or being killed? Name such\npenalties one by one, and mention the men who have scorned them; one does not need to hunt for\nthem, ? it is simply a matter of selection. Sentence of conviction was borne by Rutilius as if the\ninjustice of the decision were the only thing which annoyed him. Exile was endured by Metellus with\ncourage, by Rutilius even with gladness; for the former consented to come back only because his\ncountry called him; the latter refused to return when Sulla summoned him, ? and nobody in those\ndays said \"No\" to Sulla! Socrates in prison discoursed, and declined to flee when certain persons\ngave him the opportunity; he remained there, in order to free mankind from the\nfear of two most grievous things, death and imprisonment. Mucius put his hand into the fire. It is\npainful to be burned; but how much more painful to inflict such suffering upon oneself! Here was a\nman of no learning, not primed to face death and pain by any words of wisdom, and equipped only\nwith the courage of a soldier, who punished himself for his fruitless daring; he stood and watched his\nown right hand falling away piecemeal on the enemy's brazier, nor did he withdraw the dissolving\nlimb, with its uncovered bones, until his foe removed the fire. He might have accomplished\nsomething more successful in that camp, but never anything more brave. See how much keener a\nbrave man is to lay hold of danger than a cruel man is to inflict it: Porsenna was more ready to\npardon Mucius for wishing to slay him than Mucius to pardon himself for failing to slay Porsenna!", "Hast thou reason? I have.- Why then dost not thou use it? For if this does its own work, what else\ndost thou wish?", "\"Oh,\" say you, \"those stories have been droned to death in all the schools; pretty soon, when you\nreach the topic 'On Despising Death,' you will be telling me about Cato.\" But why should I not tell\nyou about Cato, how he read Plato's book on that last glorious night, with a sword laid at his pillow?\nHe had provided these two requisites for his last moments, ? the first, that he might have the will to\ndie, and the second, that he might have the means. So he put his affairs in order, ? as well as one\ncould put in order that which was ruined and near its end, ? and thought that he ought to see to it\nthat no one should have the power to slay or the good fortune to save Cato. Drawing the sword, ?\nwhich he had kept unstained from all bloodshed against the final day, ? he cried: \"Fortune, you have\naccomplished nothing by resisting all my endeavours. I have fought, till now, for my country's\nfreedom, and not for my own, I did not strive so doggedly to be free, but only to live among the free.\nNow, since the affairs of mankind are beyond hope, let Cato be withdrawn to safety.\" So saying, he\ninflicted a mortal wound upon his body. After the physicians had bound it up, Cato had less blood\nand less strength, but no less courage; angered now not only at Caesar but also at himself, he\nrallied his unarmed hands against his wound, and expelled, rather than dismissed, that noble soul\nwhich had been so defiant of all worldly power.", "I am not now heaping up these illustrations for the purpose of exercising my wit, but for the purpose\nof encouraging you to face that which is thought to be most terrible. And I shall encourage you all\nthe more easily by showing that not only resolute men have despised that moment when the soul\nbreathes its last, but that certain persons, who were craven in other respects, have equalled in this\nregard the courage of the bravest. Take, for example, Scipio, the father-in-law of Gnaeus Pompeius:\nhe was driven back upon the African coast by a head-wind and saw his ship in the power of the\nenemy. He therefore pierced his body with a sword; and when they asked where the commander\nwas, he replied: \"All is well with the commander.\" These words brought him up to the level of his\nancestors and suffered not the glory which fate gave to the Scipios in Africa to lose its continuity. It\nwas a great deed to conquer Carthage, but a greater deed to conquer death. \"All is well with the\ncommander!\" Ought a general to die otherwise, especially one of Cato's generals? I shall not refer\nyou to history, or collect examples of those men who throughout the ages have despised death; for\nthey are very many. Consider these times of ours, whose enervation and over-refinement call forth\nour complaints; they nevertheless will include men of every rank, of every lot in life, and of every\nage, who have cut short their misfortunes by death.", "Believe me, Lucilius; death is so little to be feared that through its good offices nothing is to be\nfeared. Therefore, when your enemy threatens, listen unconcernedly. Although your conscience\nmakes you confident, yet, since many things have weight which are outside your case, both hope for\nthat which is utterly just, and prepare yourself against that which is utterly unjust. Remember,\nhowever, before all else, to strip things of all that disturbs and confuses, and to see what each is at\nbottom; you will then comprehend that they contain nothing fearful except the actual fear. What you\nsee happening to boys happens also to ourselves, who are only slightly bigger boys: when those\nwhom they love, with whom they daily associate, with whom they play, appear with masks on, the\nboys are frightened out of their wits. We should strip the mask, not only from men, but from things,\nand restore to each object its own aspect.", "\"Why dost thou hold up before my eyes swords, fires, and a throng of executioners raging about\nthee? Take away all that vain show, behind which thou lurkest and scarest fools! Ah! thou art naught\nbut Death, whom only yesterday a manservant of mine and a maid-servant did despise! Why dost\nthou again unfold and spread before me, with all that great display, the whip and the rack? Why are\nthose engines of torture made ready, one for each several member of the body, and all the other\ninnumerable machines for tearing a man apart piecemeal? Away with all such stuff, which makes us\nnumb with terror! And thou, silence the groans, the cries, and the bitter shrieks ground out of the\nvictim as he is torn on the rack! Forsooth thou are naught but Pain, scorned by yonder gout-ridden\nwretch, endured by yonder dyspeptic in the midst of his dainties, borne bravely by the girl in travail.\nSlight thou art, if I can bear thee; short thou art if I cannot bear thee!\"", "Ponder these words which you have often heard and often uttered. Moreover, prove by the result\nwhether that which you have heard and uttered is true. For there is a very disgraceful charge often\nbrought against our school, ? that we deal with the words, and not with the deeds, of philosophy.", "What, have you only at this moment learned that death is hanging over your head, at this moment\nexile, at this moment grief? You were born to these perils. Let us think of everything that can happen\nas something which will happen. I know that you have really done what I advise you to do; I now\nwarn you not to drown your soul in these petty anxieties of yours; if you do, the soul will be dulled\nand will have too little vigour left when the time comes for it to arise. Remove the mind from this\ncase of yours to the case of men in general. Say to yourself that our petty bodies are mortal and\nfrail; pain can reach them from other sources than from wrong or the might of the stronger. Our\npleasures themselves become torments; banquets bring indigestion, carousals paralysis of the\nmuscles and palsy, sensual habits affect the feet, the hands, and every joint of the body.", "I may become a poor man; I shall then be one among many. I may be exiled; I shall then regard\nmyself as born in the place to which I shall be sent. They may put me in chains. What then? Am I\nfree from bonds now? Behold this clogging burden of a body, to which nature has fettered me! \"I\nshall die,\" you say; you mean to say \"I shall cease to run the risk of sickness; I shall cease to run the\nrisk of imprisonment; I shall cease to run the risk of death.\" I am not so foolish as to go through at\nthis juncture the arguments which Epicurus harps upon, and say that the terrors of the world below\nare idle, ? that Ixion does not whirl round on his wheel, that Sisyphus does not shoulder his stone\nuphill, that a man's entrails cannot be restored and devoured every day; no one is so childish as to\nfear Cerberus, or the shadows, or the spectral garb of those who are held together by naught but\ntheir unfleshed bones. Death either annihilates us or strips us bare. If we are then released, there\nremains the better part, after the burden has been withdrawn; if we are annihilated, nothing remains;\ngood and bad are alike removed.", "Allow me at this point to quote a verse of yours, first suggesting that, when you wrote it, you meant it\nfor yourself no less than for others. It is ignoble to say one thing and mean another; and how much\nmore ignoble to write one thing and mean another! I remember one day you were handling the\nwell-known commonplace, ? that we do not suddenly fall on death, but advance towards it by slight\ndegrees; we die every day. For every day a little of our life is taken from us; even when we are\ngrowing, our life is on the wane. We lose our childhood, then our boyhood, and then our youth.\nCounting even yesterday, all past time is lost time; the very day which we are now spending is\nshared between ourselves and death. It is not the last drop that empties the water-clock, but all that\nwhich previously has flowed out; similarly, the final hour when we cease to exist does not of itself\nbring death; it merely of itself completes the death-process. We reach death at that moment, but we\nhave been a long time on the way. In describing this situation, you said in your customary, style (for\nyou are always impressive, but never more pungent than when you are putting the truth in\nappropriate words):", "Not single is the death which comes; the death\nWhich takes us off is but the last of all.", "I prefer that you should read your own words rather than my letter; for then it will be clear to you that\nthis death, of which we are afraid, is the last but not the only death.", "Thou hast existed as a part. Thou shalt disappear in that which produced thee; but rather thou shalt\nbe received back into its seminal principle by transmutation.", "I see what you are looking for; you are asking what I have packed into my letter, what inspiriting\nsaying from some master-mind, what useful precept. So I shall send you something dealing with this\nvery subject which has been under discussion. Epicurus upbraids those who crave, as much as\nthose who shrink from, death: \"It is absurd,\" he says, \"to run towards death because you are tired of\nlife, when it is your manner of life that has made you run towards death.\" And in another passage:\n\"What is so absurd as to seek death, when it is through fear of death that you have robbed your life\nof peace?\" And you may add a third statement, of the same stamp: \"Men are so thoughtless, nay, so\nmad, that some, through fear of death, force themselves to die.\"", "Whichever of these ideas you ponder, you will strengthen your mind for the endurance alike of death\nand of life. For we need to be warned and strengthened in both directions, ? not to love or to hate\nlife overmuch; even when reason advises us to make an end of it, the impulse is not to be adopted\nwithout reflection or at headlong speed. The brave and wise man should not beat a hasty retreat\nfrom life; he should make a becoming exit. And above all, he should avoid the weakness which has\ntaken possession of so many, ? the lust for death. For just as there is an unreflecting tendency of\nthe mind towards other things, so, my dear Lucilius, there is an unreflecting tendency towards death;\nthis often seizes upon the noblest and most spirited men, as well as upon the craven and the abject.\nThe former despise life; the latter find it irksome.", "Others also are moved by a satiety of doing and seeing the same things, and not so much by a\nhatred of life as because they are cloyed with it. We slip into this condition, while philosophy itself\npushes us on, and we say: \"How long must I endure the same things? Shall I continue to wake and\nsleep, be hungry and be cloyed, shiver and perspire? There is an end to nothing; all things are\nconnected in a sort of circle; they flee and they are pursued. Night is close at the heels of day, day\nat the heels of night; summer ends in autumn, winter rushes after autumn, and winter softens into\nspring; all nature in this way passes, only to return. I do nothing new; I see nothing new; sooner or\nlater one sickens of this, also.\" There are many who think that living is not painful, but superfluous.\nFarewell.", "With regard to these two friends of ours, we must proceed along different lines; the faults of the one\nare to be corrected, the other's are to be crushed out. I shall take every liberty; for I do not love this\none if I am unwilling to hurt his feelings. \"What,\" you say, \"do you expect to keep a forty-year-old\nward under your tutelage? Consider his age, how hardened it now is, and past handling! Such a\nman cannot be re-shaped; only young minds are moulded.\" I do not know whether I shall make\nprogress; but I should prefer to lack success rather than to lack faith. You need not despair of curing\nsick men even when the disease is chronic, if only you hold out against excess and force them to do\nand submit to many things against their will. As regards our other friend I am not sufficiently\nconfident, either, except for the fact that he still has sense of shame enough to blush for his sins.\nThis modesty should be fostered; so long as it endures in his soul, there is some room for hope. But\nas for this veteran of yours, I think we should deal more carefully with him, that he may not become\ndesperate about himself. There is no better time to approach him than now, when he has an interval\nof rest and seems like one who has corrected his faults. Others have been cheated by this interval\nof virtue on his part, but he does not cheat me. I feel sure that these faults will return, as it were, with\ncompound interest, for just now, I am certain, they are in abeyance but not absent. I shall devote\nsome time to the matter, and try to see whether or not something can be done.", "But do you yourself, as indeed you are doing, show me that you are stout-hearted; lighten your\nbaggage for the march. None of our possessions is essential. Let us return to the law of nature; for\nthen riches are laid up for us. The things which we actually need are free for all, or else cheap;\nnature craves only bread and water. No one is poor according to this standard; when a man has\nlimited his desires within these bounds, he can challenge the happiness of Jove himself, as Epicurus\nsays. I must insert in this letter one or two more of his sayings: \"Do everything as if Epicurus were\nwatching you.\" There is no real doubt that it is good for one to have appointed a guardian over\noneself, and to have someone whom you may look up to, someone whom you may regard as a\nwitness of your thoughts. It is, indeed, nobler by far to live as you would live under the eyes of some\ngood man, always at your side; but nevertheless I am content if you only act, in whatever you do, as\nyou would act if anyone at all were looking on; because solitude prompts us to all kinds of evil. And\nwhen you have progressed so far that you have also respect for yourself, you may send away your\nattendant; but until then, set as a guard over yourself the authority of some man, whether your\nchoice be the great Cato or Scipio, or Laelius, ? or any man in whose presence even abandoned\nwretches would check their bad impulses. Meantime, you are engaged in making of yourself the sort\nof person in whose company you would not dare to sin. When this aim has been accomplished and\nyou begin to hold yourself in some esteem, I shall gradually allow you to do what Epicurus, in\nanother passage, suggests: \"The time when you should most of all withdraw into yourself is when\nyou are forced to be in a crowd.\"", "You ought to make yourself of a different stamp from the multitude. Therefore, while it is not yet safe\nto withdraw into solitude, seek out certain individuals; for everyone is better off in the company of\nsomebody or other, ? no matter who, ? than in his own company alone. \"The time when you should\nmost of all withdraw into yourself is when you are forced to be in a crowd.\" Yes, provided that you\nare a good, tranquil, and self-restrained man; otherwise, you had better withdraw into a crowd in\norder to get away from your self. Alone, you are too close to a rascal. Farewell.", "I was just lately telling you that I was within sight of old age. I am now afraid that I have left old age\nbehind me. For some other word would now apply to my years, or at any rate to my body; since old\nage means a time of life that is weary rather than crushed. You may rate me in the worn-out class, ?\nof those who are nearing the end.", "Nevertheless, I offer thanks to myself, with you as witness; for I feel that age has done no damage\nto my mind, though I feel its effects on my constitution. Only my vices, and the outward aids to these\nvices, have reached senility; my mind is strong and rejoices that it has but slight connexion with the\nbody. It has laid aside the greater part of its load. It is alert; it takes issue with me on the subject of\nold age; it declares that old age is its time of bloom. Let me take it at its word, and let it make the\nmost of the advantages it possesses. The mind bids me do some thinking and consider how much\nof this peace of spirit and moderation of character I owe to wisdom and how much to my time of life;\nit bids me distinguish carefully what I cannot do and what I do not want to do. . . . For why should\none complain or regard it as a disadvantage, if powers which ought to come to an end have failed?\n\"But,\" you say, \"it is the greatest possible disadvantage to be worn out and to die off, or rather, if I\nmay speak literally, to melt away! For we are not suddenly smitten and laid low; we are worn away,\nand every day reduces our powers to a certain extent.\"", "But is there any better end to it all than to glide off to one's proper haven, when nature slips the\ncable? Not that there is anything painful in a shock and a sudden departure from existence; it is\nmerely because this other way of departure is easy, ? a gradual withdrawal. I, at any rate, as if the\ntest were at hand and the day were come which is to pronounce its decision concerning all the years\nof my life, watch over myself and commune thus with myself: \"The showing which we have made up\nto the present time, in word or deed, counts for nothing. All this is but a trifling and deceitful pledge\nof our spirit, and is wrapped in much charlatanism. I shall leave it to Death to determine what\nprogress I have made. Therefore with no faint heart I am making ready for the day when, putting\naside all stage artifice and actor's rouge, I am to pass judgment upon myself, ? whether I am merely\ndeclaiming brave sentiments, or whether I really feel them; whether all the bold threats I have\nuttered against fortune are a pretence and a farce. Put aside the opinion of the world; it is always\nwavering and always takes both sides. Put aside the studies which you have pursued throughout\nyour life;\nDeath will deliver the final judgment in your case. This is what I mean: your debates and learned\ntalks, your maxims gathered from the teachings of the wise, your cultured conversation, ? all these\nafford no proof of the real strength of your soul. Even the most timid man can deliver a bold speech.\nWhat you have done in the past will be manifest only at the time when you draw your last breath. I\naccept the terms; I do not shrink from the decision.\" This is what I say to myself, but I would have\nyou think that I have said it to you also. You are younger; but what does that matter? There is no\nfixed count of our years. You do not know where death awaits you; so be ready for it everywhere.", "I was just intending to stop, and my hand was making ready for the closing sentence; but the rites\nare still to be performed and the travelling money for the letter disbursed. And just assume that I am\nnot telling where I intend to borrow the necessary sum; you know upon whose coffers I depend.\nWait for me but a moment, and I will pay you from my own account; meanwhile, Epicurus will oblige\nme with these words: \"Think on death,\" or rather, if you prefer the phrase, on \"migration to heaven.\"\nThe meaning is clear, ? that it is a wonderful thing to learn thoroughly how to die. You may deem it\nsuperfluous to learn a text that can be used only once; but that is just the reason why we ought to\nthink on a thing. When we can never prove whether we really know a thing, we must always be\nlearning it. \"Think on death.\" In saying this, he bids us think on freedom. He who has learned to die\nhas unlearned slavery; he is above any external power, or, at any rate, he is beyond it. What terrors\nhave prisons and bonds and bars for him? His way out is clear. There is only one chain which binds\nus to life, and that is the love of life. The chain may not be cast off, but it may be rubbed away, so\nthat, when necessity shall demand, nothing may retard or hinder us from being ready to do at once\nthat which at some time we are bound to do. Farewell.", "Many grains of frankincense on the same altar: one falls before, another falls after; but it makes no\ndifference.", "\"What,\" say you, \"are you giving me advice? Indeed, have you already advised yourself, already\ncorrected your own faults? Is this the reason why you have leisure to reform other men?\" No, I am\nnot so shameless as to undertake to cure my fellow-men when I am ill myself. I am, however,\ndiscussing with you troubles which concern us both, and sharing the remedy with you, just as if we\nwere lying ill in the same hospital. Listen to me, therefore, as you would if I were talking to myself. I\nam admitting you to my inmost thoughts, and am having it out with myself, merely making use of you\nas my pretext. I keep crying out to myself: \"Count your years, and you will be ashamed to desire and\npursue the same things you desired in your boyhood days. Of this one thing make sure against your\ndying day, ? let your faults die before you die. Away with those disordered pleasures, which must be\ndearly paid for; it is not only those which are to come that harm me, but also those which have come\nand gone. Just as crimes, even if they have not been detected when they were committed, do not\nallow anxiety to end with them; so with guilty pleasures, regret remains even after the pleasures are\nover. They are not substantial, they are not trustworthy; even if they do not harm us, they are\nfleeting. Cast about rather for some good which will abide. But there can be no such good except as\nthe soul discovers it for itself within itself. Virtue alone affords everlasting and peace-giving joy; even\nif some obstacle arise, it is but like an intervening cloud, which floats beneath the sun but never\nprevails against it.\"", "When will it be your lot to attain this joy? Thus far, you have indeed not been sluggish, but you must\nquicken your pace. Much toil remains; to confront it, you must yourself lavish all your waking hours,\nand all your efforts, if you wish the result to be accomplished. This matter cannot be delegated to\nsomeone else. The other kind of literary activity admits of outside assistance. Within our own time\nthere was a certain rich man named Calvisius Sabinus; he had the bank-account and the brains of a\nfreedman. I never saw a man whose good fortune was a greater offence against propriety. His\nmemory was so faulty that he would sometimes forget the name of Ulysses, or Achilles, or Priam, ?\nnames which we know as well as we know those of our own attendants. No major-domo in his\ndotage, who cannot give men their right names, but is compelled to invent names for them, ? no\nsuch man, I say, calls off the names of his master's tribesmen so atrociously as Sabinus used to call\noff the Trojan and Achaean heroes. But none the less did he desire to appear learned. So he\ndevised this short cut to learning: he paid fabulous prices for slaves, ? one to know Homer by heart\nand another to know Hesiod; he also delegated a special slave to each of the nine lyric poets. You\nneed not wonder that he paid high prices for these slaves; if he did not find them ready to hand he\nhad them made to order. After collecting this retinue, he began to make life miserable for his guests;\nhe would keep these fellows at the foot of his couch, and ask them from time to time for verses\nwhich he might repeat, and then frequently break down in the middle of a word. Satellius Quadratus,\na feeder, and consequently a fawner, upon addle-pated millionaires, and also (for this quality goes\nwith the other two) a flouter of them, suggested to Sabinus that he should have philologists to gather\nup the bits. Sabinus remarked that each slave cost him one hundred thousand sesterces; Satellius\nreplied: \"You might have bought as many book-cases for a smaller sum.\" But Sabinus held to the\nopinion that what any member of his household knew, he himself knew also. This same Satellius\nbegan to advise Sabinus to take wrestling lessons, ? sickly, pale, and thin as he was, Sabinus\nanswered: \"How can I? I can scarcely stay alive now.\" \"Don't say that, I implore you,\" replied the\nother, \"consider how many perfectly healthy slaves you have!\" No man is able to borrow or buy a\nsound mind; in fact, as it seems to me, even though sound minds were for sale, they would not find", "buyers. Depraved minds, however, are bought and sold every day.", "But let me pay off my debt and say farewell: \"Real wealth is poverty adjusted to the law of Nature.\"\nEpicurus has this saying in various ways and contexts; but it can never be repeated too often, since\nit can never be learned too well. For some persons the remedy should be merely prescribed; in the\ncase of others, it should be forced down their throats. Farewell.", "Do you suppose that you alone have had this experience? Are you surprised, as if it were a novelty,\nthat after such long travel and so many changes of scene you have not been able to shake off the\ngloom and heaviness of your mind? You need a change of soul rather than a change of climate.\nThough you may cross vast spaces of sea, and though, as our Vergil remarks,", "your faults will follow you whithersoever you travel. Socrates made the same remark to one who\ncomplained; he said: \"Why do you wonder that globe-trotting does not help you, seeing that you\nalways take yourself with you? The reason which set you wandering is ever at your heels.\" What\npleasure is there in seeing new lands? Or in surveying cities and spots of interest? All your bustle is\nuseless. Do you ask why such flight does not help you? It is because you flee along with yourself.\nYou must lay aside the burdens of the mind; until you do this, no place will satisfy you. Reflect that\nyour present behaviour is like that of the prophetess whom Vergil describes: she is excited and\ngoaded into fury, and contains within herself much inspiration that is not her own:", "The priestess raves, if haply she may shake\nThe great god from her heart.", "You wander hither and yon, to rid yourself of the burden that rests upon you, though it becomes\nmore troublesome by reason of your very restlessness, just as in a ship the cargo when stationary\nmakes no trouble, but when it shifts to this side or that, it causes the vessel to heel more quickly in\nthe direction where it has settled. Anything you do tells against you, and you hurt yourself by your\nvery unrest; for you are shaking up a sick man.", "That trouble once removed, all change of scene will become pleasant; though you may be driven to\nthe uttermost ends of the earth, in whatever corner of a savage land you may find yourself, that\nplace, however forbidding, will be to you a hospitable abode. The person you are matters more than\nthe place to which you go; for that reason we should not make the mind a bondsman to any one\nplace. Live in this belief: \"I am not born for any one corner of the universe; this whole world is my\ncountry.\" If you saw this fact clearly, you would not be surprised at getting no benefit from the fresh\nscenes to which you roam each time through weariness of the old scenes. For the first would have\npleased you in each case, had you believed it wholly yours. As it is, however, you are not\njourneying; you are drifting and being driven, only exchanging one place for another, although that\nwhich you seek, ? to live well, ? is found everywhere. Can there be any spot so full of confusion as\nthe Forum? Yet you can live quietly even there, if necessary. Of course, if one were allowed to make\none's own arrangements, I should flee far from the very sight and neighbourhood of the Forum. For\njust as pestilential places assail even the strongest constitution, so there are some places which are\nalso unwholesome for a healthy mind which is not yet quite sound, though recovering\nfrom its ailment. I disagree with those who strike out into the midst of the billows and, welcoming a\nstormy existence, wrestle daily in hardihood of soul with life's problems. The wise man will endure all\nthat, but will not choose it; he will prefer to be at peace rather than at war. It helps little to have cast\nout your own faults if you must quarrel with those of others. Says one: \"There were thirty tyrants\nsurrounding Socrates, and yet they could not break his spirit\"; but what does it matter how many\nmasters a man has? \"Slavery\" has no plural; and he who has scorned it is free, ? no matter amid\nhow large a mob of over-lords he stands.", "It is time to stop, but not before I have paid duty. \"The knowledge of sin is the beginning of\nsalvation.\" This saying of Epicurus seems to me to be a noble one. For he who does not know that\nhe has sinned does not desire correction; you must discover yourself in the wrong before you can\nreform yourself. Some boast of their faults. Do you think that the man has any thought of mending\nhis ways who counts over his vices as if they were virtues? Therefore, as far as possible, prove\nyourself guilty, hunt up charges against yourself; play the part, first of accuser, then of judge, last of\nintercessor. At times be harsh with yourself. Farewell.", "You have been inquiring about our friend Marcellinus and you desire to know how he is getting\nalong. He seldom comes to see me, for no other reason than that he is afraid to hear the truth, and\nat present he is removed from any danger of hearing it; for one must not talk to a man unless he is\nwilling to listen. That is why it is often doubted whether Diogenes and the other Cynics, who\nemployed an undiscriminating freedom of speech and offered advice to any who came in their way,\nought to have pursued such a plan. For what if one should chide the deaf or those who are\nspeechless from birth or by illness? But you answer: \"Why should I spare words? They cost nothing.\nI cannot know whether I shall help the man to whom I give advice; but I know well that I shall help\nsomeone if I advise many. I must scatter this advice by the handful. It is impossible that one who\ntries often should not sometime succeed.\"", "Within ten days thou wilt seem a god to those to whom thou art now a beast and an ape, if thou wilt\nreturn to thy principles and the worship of reason.", "This very thing, my dear Lucilius, is, I believe, exactly what a great-souled man ought not to do; his\ninfluence is weakened; it has too little effect upon those whom it might have set right if it had not\ngrown so stale. The archer ought not to hit the mark only sometimes; he ought to miss it only\nsometimes. That which takes effect by chance is not an art. Now wisdom is an art; it should have a\ndefinite aim, choosing only those who will make progress, but withdrawing from those whom it has\ncome to regard as hopeless, ? yet not abandoning them too soon, and just when the case is\nbecoming hopeless trying drastic remedies.", "As to our friend Marcellinus, I have not yet lost hope. He can still be saved, but the helping hand\nmust be offered soon. There is indeed danger that he may pull his helper down; for there is in him a\nnative character of great vigour, though it is already inclining to wickedness. Nevertheless I shall\nbrave this danger and be bold enough to show him his faults. He will act in his usual way; he will\nhave recourse to his wit, ? the wit that can call forth smiles even from mourners. He will turn the jest,\nfirst against himself, and then against me. He will forestall every word which I am about to utter. He\nwill quiz our philosophic systems; he will accuse philosophers of accepting doles, keeping\nmistresses, and indulging their appetites. He will point out to me one philosopher who has been\ncaught in adultery, another who haunts the cafes, and another who appears at court. He will bring to\nmy notice Aristo, the philosopher of Marcus Lepidus, who used to hold discussions in his carriage;\nfor that was the time which he had taken for editing his researches, so that Scaurus said of him\nwhen asked to what school he belonged: \"At any rate, he isn't one of the Walking Philosophers.\"\nJulius Graecinus, too, a man of distinction, when asked for an opinion on the same point, replied: \"I\ncannot tell you; for I don't know what he does when dismounted,\" as if the query referred to a\nchariot-gladiator. It is mountebanks of that sort, for whom it would be more creditable to have left\nphilosophy alone than to traffic in her, whom Marcellinus will throw in my teeth. But I have decided to\nput up with taunts; he may stir my laughter, but I perchance shall stir him to tears; or, if he persist in\nhis jokes, I shall rejoice, so to speak, in the midst of sorrow, because he is blessed with such a\nmerry sort of lunacy. But that kind of merriment does not last long. Observe such men, and you will\nnote that within a short space of time they laugh to excess and rage to excess. It is my plan to\napproach him and to show him how much greater was his worth when many thought it less. Even\nthough I shall not root out his faults, I shall put a check upon them; they will not cease, but they will\nstop for a time; and perhaps they will even cease, if they get the habit of stopping. This is a thing not\nto be despised, since to men who are seriously stricken the blessing of relief is a substitute for\nhealth. So while I prepare myself to deal with Marcellinus, do you in the meantime, who are able,\nand who understand whence and whither you have made your way, and who for that reason have", "an inkling of the distance yet to go, regulate your character, rouse your courage, and stand firm in\nthe face of things which have terrified you. Do not count the number of those who inspire fear in you.\nWould you not regard as foolish one who was afraid of a multitude in a place where only one at a\ntime could pass? Just so, there are not many who have access to you to slay you, though there are\nmany who threaten you with death. Nature has so ordered it that, as only one has given you life, so\nonly one will take it away.", "If you had any shame, you would have let me off from paying the last instalment. Still, I shall not be\nniggardly either, but shall discharge my debts to the last penny and force upon you what I still owe:\n\"I have never wished to cater to the crowd; for what I know, they do not approve, and what they\napprove, I do not know.\" \"Who said this?\" you ask, as if you were ignorant whom I am pressing into\nservice; it is Epicurus. But this same watchword rings in your ears from every sect, ? Peripatetic,\nAcademic, Stoic, Cynic. For who that is pleased by virtue can please the crowd? It takes trickery to\nwin popular approval; and you must needs make yourself like unto them; they will withhold their\napproval if they do not recognize you as one of themselves. However, what you think of yourself is\nmuch more to the point than what others think of you. The favour of ignoble men can be won only by\nignoble means. What benefit, then, will that vaunted philosophy confer, whose praises we sing, and\nwhich, we are told, is to be preferred to every art and every possession? Assuredly, it will make you\nprefer to please yourself rather than the populace, it will make you weigh, and not merely count,\nmen's judgments, it will make you live without fear of gods or men, it will make you either overcome\nevils or end them. Otherwise, if I see you applauded by popular acclamation, if your entrance upon\nthe scene is greeted by a roar of cheering and clapping, ? marks of distinction meet only for actors,\n? if the whole state, even the women and children, sing your praises, how can I help pitying you?\nFor I know what pathway leads to such popularity. Farewell.", "I have beheld Aufidius Bassus, that noble man, shattered in health and wrestling with his years. But\nthey already bear upon him so heavily that he cannot be raised up; old age has settled down upon\nhim with great, ? yes, with its entire, weight. You know that his body was always delicate and\nsapless. For a long time he has kept it in hand, or, to speak more correctly, has kept it together; of a\nsudden it has collapsed. Just as in a ship that springs a leak, you can always stop the first or the\nsecond fissure, but when many holes begin to open and let in water, the gaping hull cannot be\nsaved; similarly, in an old man's body, there is a certain limit up to which you can sustain and prop\nits weakness. But when it comes to resemble a decrepit building, ? when every joint begins to\nspread and while one is being repaired another falls apart, ? then it is time for a man to look about\nhim and consider how he may get out.", "But the mind of our friend Bassus is active. Philosophy bestows this boon upon us; it makes us\njoyful in the very sight of death, strong and brave no matter in what state the body may be, cheerful\nand never failing though the body fail us. A great pilot can sail even when his canvas is rent; if his\nship be dismantled, he can yet put in trim what remains of her hull and hold her to her course. This\nis what our friend Bassus is doing; and he contemplates his own end with the courage and\ncountenance which you would regard as undue indifference in a man who so contemplated\nanother's.", "This is a great accomplishment, Lucilius, and one which needs long practice to learn, ? to depart\ncalmly when the inevitable hour arrives. Other kinds of death contain an ingredient of hope: a\ndisease comes to an end; a fire is quenched; falling houses have set down in safety those whom\nthey seemed certain to crush; the sea has cast ashore unharmed those whom it had engulfed, by\nthe same force through which it drew them down; the soldier has drawn back his sword from the\nvery neck of his doomed foe. But those whom old age is leading away to death have nothing to\nhope for; old age alone grants no reprieve. No ending, to be sure, is more painless; but there is\nnone more lingering.", "Our friend Bassus seemed to me to be attending his own funeral, and laying out his own body for\nburial, and living almost as if he had survived his own death, and bearing with wise resignation his\ngrief at his own departure. For he talks freely about death, trying hard to persuade us that if this\nprocess contains any element of discomfort or of fear, it is the fault of the dying person, and not of\ndeath itself; also, that there is no more inconvenience at the actual moment than there is after it is\nover. \"And it is just as insane,\" he adds, \"for a man to fear what will not happen to him, as to fear\nwhat he will not feel if it does happen.\" Or does anyone imagine it to be possible that the agency by\nwhich feeling is removed can be itself felt? \"Therefore,\" says Bassus, \"death stands so far beyond\nall evil that it is beyond all fear of evils.\"", "I know that all this has often been said and should be often repeated; but neither when I read them\nwere such precepts so effective with me, nor when I heard them from the lips of those who were at a\nsafe distance from the fear of the things which they declared were not to be feared. But this old man\nhad the greatest weight with me when he discussed death and death was near. For I must tell you\nwhat I myself think: I hold that one is braver at the very moment of death than when one is\napproaching death. For death, when it stands near us, gives even to inexperienced men the\ncourage not to seek to avoid the inevitable. So the gladiator, who throughout the fight has been no\nmatter how faint-hearted, offers his throat to his opponent and directs the wavering blade to the vital\nspot. But an end that is near at hand, and is bound to come, calls for tenacious courage of soul; this\nis a rarer thing, and none but the wise man can manifest it.", "Accordingly, I listened to Bassus with the deepest pleasure; he was casting his vote concerning\ndeath and pointing out what sort of a thing it is when it is observed, so to speak, nearer at hand. I\nsuppose that a man would have your confidence in a larger degree, and would have more weight\nwith you, if he had come back to life and should declare from experience that there is no evil in\ndeath; and so, regarding the approach of death, those will tell you best what disquiet it brings who\nhave stood in its path, who have seen it coming and have welcomed it. Bassus may be included\namong these men; and he had no wish to deceive us. He says that it is as foolish to fear death as to\nfear old age; for death follows old age precisely as old age follows youth. He who does not wish to\ndie cannot have wished to live. For life is granted to us with the reservation that we shall die; to this\nend our path leads. Therefore, how foolish it is to fear it, since men simply await that which is sure,\nbut fear only that which is uncertain! Death has its fixed rule, ? equitable and unavoidable. Who can\ncomplain when he is governed by terms which include everyone? The chief part of equity, however,\nis equality.", "But it is superfluous at the present time to plead Nature's cause; for she wishes our laws to be\nidentical with her own; she but resolves that which she has compounded, and compounds again that\nwhich she has resolved. Moreover, if it falls to the lot of any man to be set gently adrift by old age, ?\nnot suddenly torn from life, but withdrawn bit by bit, ? oh, verily he should thank the gods, one and\nall, because, after he has had his fill, he is removed to a rest which is ordained for mankind, a rest\nthat is welcome to the weary. You may observe certain men who crave death even more earnestly\nthan others are wont to beg for life. And I do not know which men give us greater courage, ? those\nwho call for death, or those who meet it cheerfully and tranquilly, ? for the first attitude is sometimes\ninspired by madness and sudden anger, the second is the calm which results from fixed judgment.\nBefore now men have gone to meet death in a fit of rage; but when death comes to meet him, no\none welcomes it cheerfully, except the man who has long since composed himself for death.", "Do not act as if thou wert going to live ten thousand years. Death hangs over thee. While thou livest,\nwhile it is in thy power, be good.", "I admit, therefore, that I have visited this dear friend of mine more frequently on many pretexts, but\nwith the purpose of learning whether I should find him always the same, and whether his mental\nstrength was perhaps waning in company with his bodily powers. But it was on the increase, just as\nthe joy of the charioteer is wont to show itself more clearly when he is on the seventh round of the\ncourse, and nears the prize. Indeed, he often said, in accord with the counsels of Epicurus: \"I hope,\nfirst of all, that there is no pain at the moment when a man breathes his last; but if there is, one will\nfind an element of comfort in its very shortness. For no great pain lasts long. And at all events, a\nman will find relief at the very time when soul and body are being torn asunder, even though the\nprocess be accompanied by excruciating pain, in the thought that after this pain is over he can feel\nno more pain. I am sure, however, that an old man's soul is on his very lips, and that only a little\nforce is necessary to disengage it from the body. A fire which has seized upon a substance that\nsustains it needs water to quench it, or, sometimes, the destruction of the building itself; but the fire\nwhich lacks sustaining fuel dies away of its own accord.\"", "I am glad to hear such words, my dear Lucilius, ? not as new to me, but as leading me into the\npresence of an actual fact. And what then? Have I not seen many men break the thread of life? I\nhave indeed seen such men; but those have more weight with me who approach death without any\nloathing for life, letting death in, so to speak, and not pulling it towards them. Bassus kept saying: \"It\nis due to our own fault that we feel this torture, because we shrink from dying only when we believe\nthat our end is near at hand.\" But who is not near death? It is ready for us in all places and at all\ntimes. \"Let us consider,\" he went on to say, \"when some agency of death seems imminent, how\nmuch nearer are other varieties of dying which are not feared by us.\" A man is threatened with death\nby an enemy, but this form of death is anticipated by an attack of indigestion. And if we are willing to\nexamine critically the various causes of our fear, we shall find that some exist, and others only seem\nto be. We do not fear death; we fear the thought of death. For death itself is always the same\ndistance from us; wherefore, if it is to be feared at all, it is to be feared always. For what season of\nour life is exempt from death?", "But what I really ought to fear is that you will hate this long letter worse than death itself; so I shall\nstop. Do you, however, always think on death in order that you may never fear it. Farewell.", "Now I recognize my Lucilius! He is beginning to reveal the character of which he gave promise.\nFollow up the impulse which prompted you to make for all that is best, treading under your feet that\nwhich is approved by the crowd. I would not have you greater or better than you planned; for in your\ncase the mere foundations have covered a large extent of ground; only finish all that you have laid\nout, and take in hand the plans which you have had in mind. In short, you will be a wise man, if you\nstop up your ears; nor is it enough to close them with wax; you need a denser stopple than that\nwhich they say Ulysses used for his comrades. The song which he feared was alluring, but came not\nfrom every side; the song, however, which you have to fear, echoes round you not from a single\nheadland, but from every quarter of the world. Sail, therefore, not past one region which you mistrust\nbecause of its treacherous delights, but past every city. Be deaf to those who love you most of all;\nthey pray for bad things with good intentions. And, if you would be happy, entreat the gods that none\nof their fond desires for you may be brought to pass. What they wish to have heaped upon you are\nnot really good things; there is only one good, the cause and the support of a happy life, ? trust in\noneself. But this cannot be attained, unless one has learned to despise toil and to reckon it among\nthe things which are neither good nor bad. For it is not possible that a single thing should be bad at\none time and good at another, at times light and to be endured, and at times a cause of dread. Work\nis not a good. Then what is a good? I say, the scorning of work. That is why I should rebuke men\nwho toil to no purpose. But when, on the other hand, a man is struggling towards honourable things,\nin proportion as he applies himself more and more, and allows himself less and less to be beaten or\nto halt, I shall recommend his conduct and shout my encouragement, saying: \"By so much you are\nbetter! Rise, draw a fresh breath, and surmount that hill, if possible, at a single spurt!\"", "Work is the sustenance of noble minds. There is, then, no reason why, in accordance with that old\nvow of your parents, you should pick and choose what fortune you wish should fall to your lot, or\nwhat you should pray for; besides, it is base for a man who has already travelled the whole round of\nhighest honours to be still importuning the gods. What need is there of vows? Make yourself happy\nthrough your own efforts; you can do this, if once you comprehend that whatever is blended with\nvirtue is good, and that whatever is joined to vice is bad. Just as nothing gleams if it has no light\nblended with it, and nothing is black unless it contains darkness or draws to itself something of\ndimness, and as nothing is hot without the aid of fire, and nothing cold without air; so it is the\nassociation of virtue and vice that makes things honourable or base.", "What then is good? The knowledge of things. What is evil? The lack of knowledge of things. Your\nwise man, who is also a craftsman, will reject or choose in each case as it suits the occasion; but he\ndoes not fear that which he rejects, nor does he admire that which he chooses, if only he has a stout\nand unconquerable soul. I forbid you to be cast down or depressed. It is not enough if you do not\nshrink from work; ask for it. \"But,\" you say, \"is not trifling and superfluous work, and work that has\nbeen inspired by ignoble causes, a bad sort of work?\" No; no more than that which is expended\nupon noble endeavours, since the very quality that endures toil and rouses itself to hard and uphill\neffort, is of the spirit, which says: \"Why do you grow slack? It is not the part of a man to fear sweat.\"\nAnd besides this, in order that virtue may be perfect, there should be an even temperament and a\nscheme of life that is consistent with itself throughout; and this result cannot be attained without\nknowledge of things, and without the art which enables us to understand things human and things\ndivine. That is the greatest good. If you seize this good, you begin to be the associate of the gods,\nand not their suppliant.", "\"But how,\" you ask, \"does one attain that goal?\" You do not need to cross the Pennine or Graian\nhills, or traverse the Candavian waste, or face the Syrtes, or Scylla, or Charybdis, although you have\ntravelled through all these places for the bribe of a petty governorship; the journey for which nature\nhas equipped you is safe and pleasant. She has given you such gifts that you may, if you do not\nprove false to them, rise level with God. Your money, however, will not place you on a level with\nGod; for God has no property. Your bordered robe will not do this; for God is not clad in raiment; nor\nwill your reputation, nor a display of self, nor a knowledge of your name wide-spread throughout the\nworld; for no one has knowledge of God; many even hold him in low esteem, and do not suffer for\nso doing. The throng of slaves which carries your litter along the city streets and in foreign places\nwill not help you; for this God of whom I speak, though the highest and most powerful of beings,\ncarries all things on his own shoulders. Neither can beauty or strength make you blessed, for none\nof these qualities can withstand old age.", "What we have to seek for, then, is that which does not each day pass more and more under the\ncontrol of some power which cannot be withstood. And what is this? It is the soul, ? but the soul that\nis upright, good, and great. What else could you call such a soul than a god dwelling as a guest in a\nhuman body? A soul like this may descend into a Roman knight just as well as into a freedman's\nson or a slave. For what is a Roman knight, or a freedman's son, or a slave? They are mere titles,\nborn of ambition or of wrong. One may leap to heaven from the very slums.

You cannot deceive\nme; for I am with you. Live just as if I were sure to get news of your doings, nay, as if I were sure to\nbehold them. And if you wonder what particularly pleases me that I hear concerning you, it is that I\nhear nothing, that most of those whom I ask do not know what you are doing.", "This is sound practice, ? to refrain from associating with men of different stamp and different aims.\nAnd I am indeed confident that you cannot be warped, that you will stick to your purpose, even\nthough the crowd may surround and seek to distract you. What, then, is on my mind? I am not afraid\nlest they work a change in you; but I am afraid lest they may hinder your progress. And much harm\nis done even by one who holds you back, especially since life is so short; and we make it still shorter\nby our unsteadiness, by making ever fresh beginnings at life, now one and immediately another. We\nbreak up life into little bits, and fritter it away. Hasten ahead, then, dearest Lucilius, and reflect how\ngreatly you would quicken your speed if an enemy were at your back, or if you suspected the cavalry\nwere approaching and pressing hard upon your steps as you fled. It is true; the enemy is indeed\npressing upon you; you should therefore increase your speed and escape away and reach a safe\nposition, remembering continually what a noble thing it is to round out your life before death comes,\nand then await in peace the remaining portion of your time, claiming nothing for yourself, since you\nare in possession of the happy life; for such a life is not made happier for being longer. O when shall\nyou see the time when you shall know that time means nothing to you, when you shall be peaceful\nand calm, careless of the morrow, because you are enjoying your life to the full?", "Would you know what makes men greedy for the future? It is because no one has yet found himself.\nYour parents, to be sure, asked other blessings for you; but I myself pray rather that you may\ndespise all those things which your parents wished for you in abundance. Their prayers plunder\nmany another person, simply that you may be enriched. Whatever they make over to you must be\nremoved from someone else. I pray that you may get such control over yourself that your mind, now\nshaken by wandering thoughts, may at last come to rest and be steadfast, that it may be content\nwith itself and, having attained an understanding of what things are truly good, ? and they are in our\npossession as soon as we have this knowledge, ? that it may have no need of added years. He has\nat length passed beyond all necessities, ? he has won his honourable discharge and is free, ? who\nstill lives after his life has been completed. Farewell.", "You wish me to close these letters also, as I closed my former letters, with certain utterances taken\nfrom the chiefs of our school. But they did not interest themselves in choice extracts; the whole\ntexture of their work is full of strength. There is unevenness, you know, when some objects rise\nconspicuous above others. A single tree is not remarkable if the whole forest rises to the same\nheight. Poetry is crammed with utterances of this sort, and so is history. For this reason I would not\nhave you think that these utterances belong to Epicurus: they are common property and are\nemphatically our own. They are, however, more noteworthy in Epicurus, because they appear at\ninfrequent intervals and when you do not expect them, and because it is surprising that brave words\nshould be spoken at any time by a man who made a practice of being effeminate. For that is what\nmost persons maintain. In my own opinion, however, Epicurus is really a brave man, even though he\ndid wear long sleeves. Fortitude, energy, and readiness for battle are to be found among the\nPersians, just as much as among men who have girded themselves up high.", "Therefore, you need not call upon me for extracts and quotations; such thoughts as one may extract\nhere and there in the works of other philosophers run through the whole body of our writings. Hence\nwe have no \"show-window goods,\" nor do we deceive the purchaser in such a way that, if he enters\nour shop, he will find nothing except that which is displayed in the window. We allow the purchasers\nthemselves to get their samples from anywhere they please. Suppose we should desire to sort out\neach separate motto from the general stock; to whom shall we credit them? To Zeno, Cleanthes,\nChrysippus, Panaetius, or Posidonius? We Stoics are not subjects of a despot: each of us lays claim\nto his own freedom. With them, on the other hand, whatever Hermarchus says, or Metrodorus, is\nascribed to one source. In that brotherhood, everything that any man utters is spoken under the\nleadership and commanding authority of one alone. We cannot, I maintain, no matter how we try,\npick out anything from so great a multitude of things equally good.", "Wherever you direct your gaze, you will meet with something that might stand out from the rest, if\nthe context in which you read it were not equally notable.", "For this reason, give over hoping that you can skim, by means of epitomes, the wisdom of\ndistinguished men. Look into their wisdom as a whole; study it as a whole. They are working out a\nplan and weaving together, line upon line, a masterpiece, from which nothing can be taken away\nwithout injury to the whole. Examine the separate parts, if you like, provided you examine them as\nparts of the man himself. She is not a beautiful woman whose ankle or arm is praised, but she\nwhose general appearance makes you forget to admire her single attributes.", "If you insist, however, I shall not be niggardly with you, but lavish; for there is a huge multitude of\nthese passages; they are scattered about in profusion, ? they do not need to be gathered together,\nbut merely to be picked up. They do not drip forth occasionally; they flow continuously. They are\nunbroken and are closely connected. Doubtless they would be of much benefit to those who are still\nnovices and worshipping outside the shrine; for single maxims sink in more easily when they are\nmarked off and bounded like a line of verse. That is why we give to children a proverb, or that which\nthe Greeks call Chria, to be learned by heart; that sort of thing can be comprehended by the young\nmind, which cannot as yet hold more. For a man, however, whose progress is definite, to chase after\nchoice extracts and to prop his weakness by the best known and the briefest sayings and to depend\nupon his memory, is disgraceful; it is time for him to lean on himself. He should make such maxims\nand not memorize them. For it is disgraceful even for an old man, or one who has sighted old age,\nto have a note-book knowledge. \"This is what Zeno said.\" But what have you yourself said? \"This is\nthe opinion of Cleanthes.\" But what is your own opinion? How long shall you march under another\nman's orders? Take command, and utter some word which posterity will remember. Put forth\nsomething from your own stock. For this reason I hold that there is nothing of eminence in all such\nmen as these, who never create anything themselves, but always lurk in the shadow of others,\nplaying the r\u00f4le of interpreters, never daring to put once into practice what they have been so long in\nlearning. They have exercised their memories on other men's material. But it is one thing to\nremember, another to know. Remembering is merely safeguarding something entrusted to the\nmemory; knowing, however, means making everything your own; it means not depending upon the\ncopy and not all the time glancing back at the master. \"Thus said Zeno, thus said Cleanthes,\nindeed!\" Let there be a difference between yourself and your book! How long shall you be a learner?\nFrom now on be a teacher as well! \"But why,\" one asks, \"should I have to continue hearing lectures\non what I can read?\" \"The living voice,\" one replies, \"is a great help.\" Perhaps, but not the voice\nwhich merely makes itself the mouthpiece of another's words, and only performs the duty of a\nreporter.", "Consider this fact also. Those who have never attained their mental independence begin, in the first\nplace, by following the leader in cases where everyone has deserted the leader; then, in the second\nplace, they follow him in matters where the truth is still being investigated. However, the truth will\nnever be discovered if we rest contented with discoveries already made. Besides, he who follows\nanother not only discovers nothing but is not even investigating. What then? Shall I not follow in the\nfootsteps of my predecessors? I shall indeed use the old road, but if I find one that makes a shorter\ncut and is smoother to travel, I shall open the new road. Men who have made these discoveries\nbefore us are not our masters, but our guides. Truth lies open for all; it has not yet been\nmonopolized. And there is plenty of it left even for posterity to discover. Farewell.", "I grow in spirit and leap for joy and shake off my years and my blood runs warm again, whenever I\nunderstand, from your actions and your letters, how far you have outdone yourself; for as to the\nordinary man, you left him in the rear long ago. If the farmer is pleased when his tree develops so\nthat it bears fruit, if the shepherd takes pleasure in the increase of his flocks, if every man regards\nhis pupil as though he discerned in him his own early manhood, ? what, then, do you think are the\nfeelings of those who have trained a mind and moulded a young idea, when they see it suddenly\ngrown to maturity?", "He who has a vehement desire for posthumous fame does not consider that every one of those who\nremember him will himself also die very soon; then again also they who have succeeded them, until\nthe whole remembrance shall have been extinguished as it is transmitted through men who foolishly\nadmire and perish. But suppose that those who will remember are even immortal, and that the\nremembrance will be immortal, what then is this to thee? And I say not what is it to the dead, but\nwhat is it to the living? What is praise except indeed so far as it has a certain utility?

Hence it is that the larger\npart of goodness is the will to become good. You know what I mean by a good man? One who is\ncomplete, finished, ? whom no constraint or need can render bad. I see such a person in you, if only\nyou go steadily on and bend to your task, and see to it that all your actions and words harmonize\nand correspond with each other and are stamped in the same mould. If a man's acts are out of\nharmony, his soul is crooked. Farewell.", "When I urge you so strongly to your studies, it is my own interest which I am consulting; I want your\nfriendship, and it cannot fall to my lot unless you proceed, as you have begun, with the task of\ndeveloping yourself. For now, although you love me, you are not yet my friend. \"But,\" you reply, \"are\nthese words of different meaning?\" Nay, more, they are totally unlike in meaning. A friend loves you,\nof course; but one who loves you is not in every case your friend. Friendship, accordingly, is always\nhelpful, but love sometimes even does harm. Try to perfect yourself, if for no other reason, in order\nthat you may learn how to love.", "Hasten, therefore, in order that, while thus perfecting yourself for my benefit, you may not have\nlearned perfection for the benefit of another. To be sure, I am already deriving some profit by\nimagining that we two shall be of one mind, and that whatever portion of my strength has yielded to\nage will return to me from your strength, although there is not so very much difference in our ages.\nBut yet I wish to rejoice in the accomplished fact. We feel a joy over those whom we love, even\nwhen separated from them, but such a joy is light and fleeting; the sight of a man, and his presence,\nand communion with him, afford something of living pleasure; this is true, at any rate, if one not only\nsees the man one desires, but the sort of man one desires. Give yourself to me, therefore, as a gift\nof great price, and, that you may strive the more, reflect that you yourself are mortal, and that I am\nold. Hasten to find me, but hasten to find yourself first. Make progress, and, before all else,\nendeavour to be consistent with yourself. And when you would find out whether you have\naccomplished anything, consider whether you desire the same things to-day that you desired\nyesterday. A shifting of the will indicates that the mind is at sea, heading in various directions,\naccording to the course of the wind. But that which is settled and solid does not wander from its\nplace. This is the blessed lot of the completely wise man, and also, to a certain extent, of him who is\nprogressing and has made some headway. Now what is the difference between these two classes\nof men? The one is in motion, to be sure, but does not change its position; it merely tosses up and\ndown where it is; the other is not in motion at all. Farewell.", "Encourage your friend to despise stout-heartedly those who upbraid him because he has sought the\nshade of retirement and has abdicated his career of honours, and, though he might have attained\nmore, has preferred tranquillity to them all. Let him prove daily to these detractors how wisely he has\nlooked out for his own interests. Those whom men envy will continue to march past him; some will\nbe pushed out of the ranks, and others will fall. Prosperity is a turbulent thing; it torments itself. It\nstirs the brain in more ways than one, goading men on to various aims, ? some to power, and others\nto high living. Some it puffs up; others it slackens and wholly enervates.", "\"But,\" the retort comes, \"so-and-so carries his prosperity well.\" Yes; just as he carries his liquor. So\nyou need not let this class of men persuade you that one who is besieged by the crowd is happy;\nthey run to him as crowds rush for a pool of water, rendering it muddy while they drain it. But you\nsay: \"Men call our friend a trifler and a sluggard.\" There are men, you know, whose speech is awry,\nwho use the contrary terms. They called him happy; what of it? Was he happy? Even the fact that to\ncertain persons he seems a man of a very rough and gloomy cast of mind, does not trouble me.\nAristo used to say that he preferred a youth of stern disposition to one who was a jolly fellow and\nagreeable to the crowd. \"For,\" he added, \"wine which, when new, seemed harsh and sour, becomes\ngood wine; but that which tasted well at the vintage cannot stand age.\" So let them call him stern\nand a foe to his own advancement. It is just this sternness that will go well when it is aged, provided\nonly that he continues to cherish virtue and to absorb thoroughly the studies which make for culture,\n? not those with which it is sufficient for a man to sprinkle himself, but those in which the mind\nshould be steeped. Now is the time to learn. \"What? Is there any time when a man should not\nlearn?\" By no means; but just as it is creditable for every age to study, so it is not creditable for\nevery age to be instructed. An old man learning his A B C is a disgraceful and absurd object; the\nyoung man must store up, the old man must use. You will therefore be doing a thing most helpful to\nyourself if you make this friend of yours as good a man as possible; those kindnesses, they tell us,\nare to be both sought for and bestowed, which benefit the giver no less than the receiver; and they\nare unquestionably the best kind.", "Finally, he has no longer any freedom in the matter; he has pledged his word. And it is less\ndisgraceful to compound with a creditor than to compound with a promising future. To pay his debt\nof money, the business man must have a prosperous voyage, the farmer must have fruitful fields\nand kindly weather; but the debt which your friend owes can be completely paid by mere goodwill.\nFortune has no jurisdiction over character. Let him so regulate his character that in perfect peace he\nmay bring to perfection that spirit within him which feels neither loss nor gain, but remains in the\nsame attitude, no matter how things fall out. A spirit like this, if it is heaped with worldly goods, rises\nsuperior to its wealth; if, on the other hand, chance has stripped him of a part of his wealth, or even\nall, it is not impaired.", "If your friend had been born in Parthia, he would have begun, when a child, to bend the bow; if in\nGermany, he would forthwith have been brandishing his slender spear; if he had been born in the\ndays of our forefathers, he would have learned to ride a horse and smite his enemy hand to hand.\nThese are the occupations which the system of each race recommends to the individual, ? yes,\nprescribes for him. To what, then, shall this friend of yours devote his attention? I say, let him learn\nthat which is helpful against all weapons, against every kind of foe, ? contempt of death; because no\none doubts that death has in it something that inspires terror, so that it shocks even our souls, which\nnature has so moulded that they love their own existence; for otherwise there would be no need to\nprepare ourselves, and to whet our courage, to face that towards which we should move with a sort\nof voluntary instinct, precisely as all men tend to preserve their existence. No man learns a thing in\norder that, if necessity arises, he may lie down with composure upon a bed of roses; but he steels\nhis courage to this end, ? that he may not surrender his plighted faith to torture, and that, if need be,\nhe may some day stay out his watch in the trenches, even though wounded, without even leaning\non his spear; because sleep is likely to creep over men who support themselves by any prop\nwhatsoever.", "In death there is nothing harmful; for there must exist something to which it is harmful. And yet, if\nyou are possessed by so great a craving for a longer life, reflect that none of the objects which\nvanish from our gaze and are re-absorbed into the world of things, from which they have come forth\nand are soon to come forth again, is annihilated; they merely end their course and do not perish.\nAnd death, which we fear and shrink from, merely interrupts life, but does not steal it away; the time\nwill return when we shall be restored to the light of day; and many men would object to this, were\nthey not brought back in forgetfulness of the past.", "But I mean to show you later, with more care, that everything which seems to perish merely\nchanges. Since you are destined to return, you ought to depart with a tranquil mind. Mark how the\nround of the universe repeats its course; you will see that no star in our firmament is extinguished,\nbut that they all set and rise in alternation. Summer has gone, but another year will bring it again;\nwinter lies low, but will be restored by its own proper months; night has overwhelmed the sun, but\nday will soon rout the night again. The wandering stars retrace their former courses; a part of the sky\nis rising unceasingly, and a part is sinking. One word more, and then I shall stop; infants, and boys,\nand those who have gone mad, have no fear of death, and it is most shameful if reason cannot\nafford us that peace of mind to which they have been brought by their folly.

Neither worse then nor better is a thing made by being praised. I affirm this\nalso of the things which are called beautiful by the vulgar, for example, material things and works of\nart. That which is really beautiful has no need of anything; not more than law, not more than truth,\nnot more than benevolence or modesty. Which of these things is beautiful because it is praised, or\nspoiled by being blamed?

You can show me no man who knows how he began to crave that which he craves. He\nhas not been led to that pass by forethought; he has been driven to it by impulse. Fortune attacks us\nas often as we attack Fortune. It is disgraceful, instead of proceeding ahead, to be carried along,\nand then suddenly, amid the whirlpool of events, to ask in a dazed way: \"How did I get into this\ncondition?\" Farewell.", "You are right when you urge that we increase our mutual traffic in letters. But the greatest benefit is\nto be derived from conversation, because it creeps by degrees into the soul. Lectures prepared\nbeforehand and spouted in the presence of a throng have in them more noise but less intimacy.\nPhilosophy is good advice; and no one can give advice at the top of his lungs. Of course we must\nsometimes also make use of these harangues, if I may so call them, when a doubting member\nneeds to be spurred on; but when the aim is to make a man learn, and not merely to make him wish\nto learn, we must have recourse to the low-toned words of conversation.

Reason grows in the same way; it is not large to the outward view, but increases as it does\nits work. Few words are spoken; but if the mind has truly caught them, they come into their strength\nand spring up. Yes, precepts and seeds have the same quality; they produce much, and yet they\nare slight things. Only, as I said, let a favourable mind receive and assimilate them.

For the one teaches, the other stirs the memory. But I shall give you abundant\nopportunity for both. A man like you should not ask me for this authority or that; he who furnishes a\nvoucher for his statements argues himself unknown. I shall therefore write exactly what you wish,\nbut I shall do it in my own way; until then, you have many authors whose works will presumably\nkeep your ideas sufficiently in order. Pick up the list of the philosophers; that very act will compel\nyou to wake up, when you see how many men have been working for your benefit. You will desire\neagerly to be one of them yourself. For this is the most excellent quality that the noble soul has\nwithin itself, that it can be roused to honourable things.", "No man of exalted gifts is pleased with that which is low and mean; the vision of great achievement\nsummons him and uplifts him. Just as the flame springs straight into the air and cannot be cabined\nor kept down any more than it can repose in quiet, so our soul is always in motion, and the more\nardent it is, the greater its motion and activity. But happy is the man who has given it this impulse\ntoward better things! He will place himself beyond the jurisdiction of chance; he will wisely control\nprosperity; he will lessen adversity, and will despise what others hold in admiration. It is the quality\nof a great soul to scorn great things and to prefer that which is ordinary rather than that which is too\ngreat. For the one condition is useful and life-giving; but the other does harm just because it is\nexcessive. Similarly, too rich a soil makes the grain fall flat, branches break down under too heavy a\nload, excessive productiveness does not bring fruit to ripeness. This is the case with the soul also;\nfor it is ruined by uncontrolled prosperity, which is used not only to the detriment of others, but also\nto the detriment of itself. What enemy was ever so insolent to any opponent as are their pleasures to\ncertain men? The only excuse that we can allow for the incontinence and mad lust of these men is\nthe fact that they suffer the evils which they have inflicted upon others. And they are rightly harassed\nby this madness, because desire must have unbounded space for its excursions, if it transgresses\nnature's mean. For this has its bounds, but waywardness and the acts that spring from wilful lust are\nwithout boundaries. Utility measures our needs; but by what standard can you check the\nsuperfluous? It is for this reason that men sink themselves in pleasures, and they cannot do without\nthem when once they have become accustomed to them, and for this reason they are most\nwretched, because they have reached such a pass that what was once superfluous to them has\nbecome indispensable. And so they are the slaves of their pleasures instead of enjoying them; they\neven love their own ills, ? and that is the worst ill of all! Then it is that the height of unhappiness is\nreached, when men are not only attracted, but even pleased, by shameful things, and when there is\nno longer any room for a cure, now that those things which once were vices have become habits.\nFarewell.", "I thank you for writing to me so often; for you are revealing your real self to me in the only way you\ncan. I never receive a letter from you without being in your company forthwith. If the pictures of our\nabsent friends are pleasing to us, though they only refresh the memory and lighten our longing by a\nsolace that is unreal and unsubstantial, how much more pleasant is a letter, which brings us real\ntraces, real evidences, of an absent friend! For that which is sweetest when we meet face to face is\nafforded by the impress of a friend's hand upon his letter, ? recognition.", "You write me that you heard a lecture by the philosopher Serapio, when he landed at your present\nplace of residence. \"He is wont,\" you say, \"to wrench up his words with a mighty rush, and he does\nnot let them flow forth one by one, but makes them crowd and dash upon each other. For the words\ncome in such quantity that a single voice is inadequate to utter them.\" I do not approve of this in a\nphilosopher; his speech, like his life, should be composed; and nothing that rushes headlong and is\nhurried is well ordered. That is why, in Homer, the rapid style, which sweeps down without a break\nlike a snow-squall, is assigned to the younger speaker; from the old man eloquence flows gently,\nsweeter than honey.", "Therefore, mark my words; that forceful manner of speech, rapid and copious, is more suited to a\nmountebank than to a man who is discussing and teaching an important and serious subject. But I\nobject just as strongly that he should drip out his words as that he should go at top speed; he should\nneither keep the ear on the stretch, nor deafen it. For that poverty-stricken and thin-spun style also\nmakes the audience less attentive because they are weary of its stammering slowness;\nnevertheless, the word which has been long awaited sinks in more easily than the word which flits\npast us on the wing. Finally, people speak of \"handing down\" precepts to their pupils; but one is not\n\"handing down\" that which eludes the grasp. Besides, speech that deals with the truth should be\nunadorned and plain. This popular style has nothing to do with the truth; its aim is to impress the\ncommon herd, to ravish heedless ears by its speed; it does not offer itself for discussion, but\nsnatches itself away from discussion. But how can that speech govern others which cannot itself be\ngoverned? May I not also remark that all speech which is employed for the purpose of healing our\nminds, ought to sink into us? Remedies do not avail unless they remain in the system.", "If souls continue to exist, how does the air contain them from eternity?- But how does the earth\ncontain the bodies of those who have been buried from time so remote? For as here the mutation of\nthese bodies after a certain continuance, whatever it may be, and their dissolution make room for\nother dead bodies; so the souls which are removed into the air after subsisting for some time are\ntransmuted and diffused, and assume a fiery nature by being received into the seminal intelligence\nof the universe, and in this way make room for the fresh souls which come to dwell there. And this is\nthe answer which a man might give on the hypothesis of souls continuing to exist. But we must not\nonly think of the number of bodies which are thus buried, but also of the number of animals which\nare daily eaten by us and the other animals. For what a number is consumed, and thus in a manner\nburied in the bodies of those who feed on them! And nevertheless this earth receives them by\nreason of the changes of these bodies into blood, and the transformations into the aerial or the fiery\nelement.", "Besides, this sort of speech contains a great deal of sheer emptiness; it has more sound than\npower. My terrors should be quieted, my irritations soothed, my illusions shaken off, my indulgences\nchecked, my greed rebuked. And which of these cures can be brought about in a hurry? What\nphysician can heal his patient on a flying visit? May I add that such a jargon of confused and\nill-chosen words cannot afford pleasure, either? No; but just as you are well satisfied, in the majority\nof cases, to have seen through tricks which you did not think could possibly be done, so in the case\nof these word-gymnasts, ? to have heard them once is amply sufficient. For what can a man desire\nto learn or to imitate in them? What is he to think of their souls, when their speech is sent into the\ncharge in utter disorder, and cannot be kept in hand? Just as, when you run down hill, you cannot\nstop at the point where you had decided to stop, but your steps are carried along by the momentum\nof your body and are borne beyond the place where you wished to halt; so this speed of speech has\nno control over itself, nor is it seemly for philosophy; since philosophy should carefully place her\nwords, not fling them out, and should proceed step by step.", "\"What then?\" you say; \"should not philosophy sometimes take a loftier tone?\" Of course she should;\nbut dignity of character should be preserved, and this is stripped away by such violent and\nexcessive force. Let philosophy possess great forces, but kept well under control; let her stream flow\nunceasingly, but never become a torrent. And I should hardly allow even to an orator a rapidity of\nspeech like this, which cannot be called back, which goes lawlessly ahead; for how could it be\nfollowed by jurors, who are often inexperienced and untrained? Even when the orator is carried\naway by his desire to show off his powers, or by uncontrollable emotion, even then he should not\nquicken his pace and heap up words to an extent greater than the ear can endure.", "You will be acting rightly, therefore, if you do not regard those men who seek how much they may\nsay, rather than how they shall say it, and if for yourself you choose, provided a choice must be\nmade, to speak as Publius Vinicius the stammerer does. When Asellius was asked how Vinicius\nspoke, he replied: \"Gradually\"! (It was a remark of Geminus Varius, by the way: \"I don't see how you\ncan call that man 'eloquent'; why, he can't get out three words together.\") Why, then, should you not\nchoose to speak as Vinicius does? Though of course some wag may cross your path, like the\nperson who said, when Vinicius was dragging out his words one by one, as if he were dictating and\nnot speaking. \"Say, haven't you anything to say?\" And yet that were the better choice, for the\nrapidity of Quintus Haterius, the most famous orator of his age, is, in my opinion, to be avoided by a\nman of sense. Haterius never hesitated, never paused; he made only one start, and only one stop.", "However, I suppose that certain styles of speech are more or less suitable to nations also; in a\nGreek you can put up with the unrestrained style, but we Romans, even when writing, have become\naccustomed to separate our words. And our compatriot Cicero, with whom Roman oratory sprang\ninto prominence, was also a slow pacer. The Roman language is more inclined to take stock of\nitself, to weigh, and to offer something worth weighing. Fabianus, a man noteworthy because of his\nlife, his knowledge, and, less important than either of these, his eloquence also, used to discuss a\nsubject with dispatch rather than with haste; hence you might call it ease rather than speed. I\napprove this quality in the wise man; but I do not demand it; only let his speech proceed\nunhampered, though I prefer that it should be deliberately uttered rather than spouted.", "However, I have this further reason for frightening you away from the latter malady, namely, that you\ncould only be successful in practising this style by losing your sense of modesty; you would have to\nrub all shame from your countenance, and refuse to hear yourself speak. For that heedless flow will\ncarry with it many expressions which you would wish to criticize. And, I repeat, you could not attain it\nand at the same time preserve your sense of shame. Moreover, you would need to practise every\nday, and transfer your attention from subject matter to words. But words, even if they came to you\nreadily and flowed without any exertion on your part, yet would have to be kept under control. For\njust as a less ostentatious gait becomes a philosopher, so does a restrained style of speech, far\nremoved from boldness. Therefore, the ultimate kernel of my remarks is this: I bid you be slow of\nspeech. Farewell.", "You are doing an excellent thing, one which will be wholesome for you, if, as you write me, you are\npersisting in your effort to attain sound understanding; it is foolish to pray for this when you can\nacquire it from yourself. We do not need to uplift our hands towards heaven, or to beg the keeper of\na temple to let us approach his idol's ear, as if in this way our prayers were more likely to be heard.\nGod is near you, he is with you, he is within you. This is what I mean, Lucilius: a holy spirit indwells\nwithin us, one who marks our good and bad deeds, and is our guardian. As we treat this spirit, so\nare we treated by it. Indeed, no man can be good without the help of God. Can one rise superior to\nfortune unless God helps him to rise? He it is that gives noble and upright counsel. In each good\nman", "If ever you have come upon a grove that is full of ancient trees which have grown to an unusual\nheight, shutting out a view of the sky by a veil of pleached and intertwining branches, then the\nloftiness of the forest, the seclusion of the spot, and your marvel at the thick unbroken shade in the\nmidst of the open spaces, will prove to you the presence of deity. Or if a cave, made by the deep\ncrumbling of the rocks, holds up a mountain on its arch, a place not built with hands but hollowed\nout into such spaciousness by natural causes, your soul will be deeply moved by a certain intimation\nof the existence of God. We worship the sources of mighty rivers; we erect altars at places where\ngreat streams burst suddenly from hidden sources; we adore springs of hot water as divine, and\nconsecrate certain pools because of their dark waters or their immeasurable depth. If you see a man\nwho is unterrified in the midst of dangers, untouched by desires, happy in adversity, peaceful amid\nthe storm, who looks down upon men from a higher plane, and views the gods on a footing of\nequality, will not a feeling of reverence for him steal over you? Will you not say: \"This quality is too\ngreat and too lofty to be regarded as resembling this petty body in which it dwells? A divine power\nhas descended upon that man.\" When a soul rises superior to other souls, when it is under control,\nwhen it passes through every experience as if it were of small account, when it smiles at our fears\nand at our prayers, it is stirred by a force from heaven. A thing like this cannot stand upright unless it\nbe propped by the divine. Therefore, a greater part of it abides in that place from whence it came\ndown to earth. Just as the rays of the sun do indeed touch the earth, but still abide at the source\nfrom which they are sent; even so the great and hallowed soul, which has come down in order that\nwe may have a nearer knowledge of divinity, does indeed associate with us, but still cleaves to its\norigin; on that source it depends, thither it turns its gaze and strives to go, and it concerns itself with\nour doings only as a being superior to ourselves.", "What, then, is such a soul? One which is resplendent with no external good, but only with its own.\nFor what is more foolish than to praise in a man the qualities which come from without? And what is\nmore insane than to marvel at characteristics which may at the next instant be passed on to\nsomeone else? A golden bit does not make a better horse. The lion with gilded mane, in process of\nbeing trained and forced by weariness to endure the decoration, is sent into the arena in quite a\ndifferent way from the wild lion whose spirit is unbroken; the latter, indeed, bold in his attack, as\nnature wished him to be, impressive because of his wild appearance, ? and it is his glory that none\ncan look upon him without fear, ? is favoured in preference to the other lion, that languid and gilded\nbrute.", "No man ought to glory except in that which is his own. We praise a vine if it makes the shoots teem\nwith increase, if by its weight it bends to the ground the very poles which hold its fruit; would any\nman prefer to this vine one from which golden grapes and golden leaves hang down? In a vine the\nvirtue peculiarly its own is fertility; in man also we should praise that which is his own. Suppose that\nhe has a retinue of comely slaves and a beautiful house, that his farm is large and large his income;\nnone of these things is in the man himself; they are all on the outside. Praise the quality in him\nwhich cannot be given or snatched away, that which is the peculiar property of the man. Do you ask\nwhat this is? It is soul, and reason brought to perfection in the soul. For man is a reasoning animal.\nTherefore, man's highest good is attained, if he has fulfilled the good for which nature designed him\nat birth. And what is it which this reason demands of him? The easiest thing in the world, ? to live in\naccordance with his own nature. But this is turned into a hard task by the general madness of\nmankind; we push one another into vice. And how can a man be recalled to salvation, when he has\nnone to restrain him, and all mankind to urge him on? Farewell.", "What is the investigation into the truth in this matter? The division into that which is material and that\nwhich is the cause of form, the formal.", "Has that friend of yours already made you believe that he is a good man? And yet it is impossible in\nso short a time for one either to become good or be known as such. Do you know what kind of man I\nnow mean when I speak of \"a good man\"? I mean one of the second grade, like your friend. For one\nof the first class perhaps springs into existence, like the phoenix, only once in five hundred years.\nAnd it is not surprising, either, that greatness develops only at long intervals; Fortune often brings\ninto being commonplace powers, which are born to please the mob; but she holds up for our\napproval that which is extraordinary by the very fact that she makes it rare.", "This man, however, of whom you spoke, is still far from the state which he professes to have\nreached. And if he knew what it meant to be \"a good man,\" he would not yet believe himself such;\nperhaps he would even despair of his ability to become good. \"But,\" you say, \"he thinks ill of evil\nmen.\" Well, so do evil men themselves; and there is no worse penalty for vice than the fact that it is\ndissatisfied with itself and all its fellows. \"But he hates those who make an ungoverned use of great\npower suddenly acquired.\" I retort that he will do the same thing as soon as he acquires the same\npowers. In the case of many men, their vices, being powerless, escape notice; although, as soon as\nthe persons in question have become satisfied with their own strength, the vices will be no less\ndaring than those which prosperity has already disclosed. These men simply lack the means\nwhereby they may unfold their wickedness. Similarly, one can handle even a poisonous snake while\nit is stiff with cold; the poison is not lacking; it is merely numbed into inaction. In the case of many\nmen, their cruelty, ambition, and indulgence only lack the favour of Fortune to make them dare\ncrimes that would match the worst. That their wishes are the same you will in a moment discover, in\nthis way: give them the power equal to their wishes.", "Do you remember how, when you declared that a certain person was under your influence, I\npronounced him fickle and a bird of passage, and said that you held him not by the foot but merely\nby a wing? Was I mistaken? You grasped him only by a feather; he left it in your hands and\nescaped. You know what an exhibition he afterwards made of himself before you, how many of the\nthings he attempted were to recoil upon his own head. He did not see that in endangering others he\nwas tottering to his own downfall. He did not reflect how burdensome were the objects which he was\nbent upon attaining, even if they were not superfluous.", "Therefore, with regard to the objects which we pursue, and for which we strive with great effort, we\nshould note this truth; either there is nothing desirable in them, or the undesirable is preponderant.\nSome objects are superfluous; others are not worth the price we pay for them. But we do not see\nthis clearly, and we regard things as free gifts when they really cost us very dear. Our stupidity may\nbe clearly proved by the fact that we hold that \"buying\" refers only to the objects for which we pay\ncash, and we regard as free gifts the things for which we spend our very selves. These we should\nrefuse to buy, if we were compelled to give in payment for them our houses or some attractive and\nprofitable estate; but we are eager to attain them at the cost of anxiety, of danger, and of lost\nhonour, personal freedom, and time; so true it is that each man regards nothing as cheaper than\nhimself.", "Let us therefore act, in all our plans and conduct, just as we are accustomed to act whenever we\napproach a huckster who has certain wares for sale; let us see how much we must pay for that\nwhich we crave. Very often the things that cost nothing cost us the most heavily; I can show you\nmany objects the quest and acquisition of which have wrested freedom from our hands. We should\nbelong to ourselves, if only these things did not belong to us.", "I would therefore have you reflect thus, not only when it is a question of gain, but also when it is a\nquestion of loss. \"This object is bound to perish.\" Yes, it was a mere extra; you will live without it just\nas easily as you have lived before. If you have possessed it for a long time, you lose it after you\nhave had your fill of it; if you have not possessed it long, then you lose it before you have become\nwedded to it. \"You will have less money.\" Yes, and less trouble. \"Less influence.\" Yes, and less\nenvy. Look about you and note the things that drive us mad, which we lose with a flood of tears; you\nwill perceive that it is not the loss that troubles us with\nreference to these things, but a notion of loss. No one feels that they have been lost, but his mind\ntells him that it has been so. He that owns himself has lost nothing. But how few men are blessed\nwith ownership of self! Farewell.", "Do you ask how the news reached me, and who informed me, that you were entertaining this idea,\nof which you had said nothing to a single soul? It was that most knowing of persons, ? gossip.\n\"What,\" you say, \"am I such a great personage that I can stir up gossip?\" Now there is no reason\nwhy you should measure yourself according to this part of the world; have regard only to the place\nwhere you are dwelling. Any point which rises above adjacent points is great, at the spot where it\nrises. For greatness is not absolute; comparison increases it or lessens it. A ship which looms large\nin the river seems tiny when on the ocean. A rudder which is large for one vessel, is small for\nanother.", "So you in your province are really of importance, though you scorn yourself. Men are asking what\nyou do, how you dine, and how you sleep, and they find out, too; hence there is all the more reason\nfor your living circumspectly. Do not, however, deem yourself truly happy until you find that you can\nlive before men's eyes, until your walls protect but do not hide you; although we are apt to believe\nthat these walls surround us, not to enable us to live more safely, but that we may sin more secretly.\nI shall mention a fact by which you may weigh the worth of a man's character: you will scarcely find\nanyone who can live with his door wide open. It is our conscience, not our pride, that has put\ndoorkeepers at our doors; we live in such a fashion that being suddenly disclosed to view is\nequivalent to being caught in the act. What profits it, however, to hide ourselves away, and to avoid\nthe eyes and ears of men? A good conscience welcomes the crowd, but a bad conscience, even in\nsolitude, is disturbed and troubled. If your deeds are honourable, let everybody know them; if base,\nwhat matters it that no one knows them, as long as you yourself know them? How wretched you are\nif you despise such a witness! Farewell.", "You are again insisting to me that you are a nobody, and saying that nature in the first place, and\nfortune in the second, have treated you too scurvily, and this in spite of the fact that you have it in\nyour power to separate yourself from the crowd and rise to the highest human happiness! If there is\nany good in philosophy, it is this, ? that it never looks into pedigrees. All men, if traced back to their\noriginal source, spring from the gods. You are a Roman knight, and your persistent work promoted\nyou to this class; yet surely there are many to whom the fourteen rows are barred; the\nsenate-chamber is not open to all; the army, too, is scrupulous in choosing those whom it admits to\ntoil and danger. But a noble mind is free to all men; according to this test, we may all gain\ndistinction. Philosophy neither rejects nor selects anyone; its light shines for all. Socrates was no\naristocrat. Cleanthes worked at a well and served as a hired man watering a garden. Philosophy did\nnot find Plato already a nobleman; it made him one. Why then should you despair of becoming able\nto rank with men like these? They are all your ancestors, if you conduct yourself in a manner worthy\nof them; and you will do so if you convince yourself at the outset that no man outdoes you in real\nnobility. We have all had the same number of forefathers; there is no man whose first beginning\ndoes not transcend memory. Plato says: \"Every king springs from a race of slaves, and every slave\nhas had kings among his ancestors.\" The flight of time, with its vicissitudes, has jumbled all such\nthings together, and Fortune has turned them upside down. Then who is well-born? He who is by\nnature well fitted for virtue. That is the one point to be considered; otherwise, if you hark back to\nantiquity, every one traces back to a date before which there is nothing. From the earliest\nbeginnings of the universe to the present time, we have been led forward out of origins that were\nalternately illustrious and ignoble. A hall full of smoke-begrimed busts does not make the nobleman.\nNo past life has been lived to lend us glory, and that which has existed before us is not ours; the\nsoul alone renders us noble, and it may rise superior to Fortune out of any earlier condition, no\nmatter what that condition has been.", "Suppose, then, that you were not a Roman knight, but a freedman, you might nevertheless by your\nown efforts come to be the only free man amid a throng of gentlemen. \"How?\" you ask. Simply by\ndistinguishing between good and bad things without patterning your opinion from the populace. You\nshould look, not to the source from which these things come, but to the goal towards which they\ntend. If there is anything that can make life happy, it is good on its own merits; for it cannot\ndegenerate into evil. Where, then, lies the mistake, since all men crave the happy life? It is that they\nregard the means for producing happiness as happiness itself, and, while seeking happiness, they\nare really fleeing from it. For although the sum and substance of the happy life is unalloyed freedom\nfrom care, and though the secret of such freedom is unshaken confidence, yet men gather together\nthat which causes worry, and, while travelling life's treacherous road, not only have burdens to bear,\nbut even draw burdens to themselves; hence they recede farther and farther from the achievement\nof that which they seek, and the more effort they expend, the more they hinder themselves and are\nset back. This is what happens when you hurry through a maze; the faster you go, the worse you\nare entangled. Farewell.", "Do not be whirled about, but in every movement have respect to justice, and on the occasion of\nevery impression maintain the faculty of comprehension or understanding.", "You complain that in your part of the world there is a scant supply of books. But it is quality, rather\nthan quantity, that matters; a limited list of reading benefits; a varied assortment serves only for\ndelight. He who would arrive at the appointed end must follow a single road and not wander through\nmany ways. What you suggest is not travelling; it is mere tramping.", "\"But,\" you say, \"I should rather have you give me advice than books.\" Still, I am ready to send you\nall the books I have, to ransack the whole storehouse. If it were possible, I should join you there\nmyself; and were it not for the hope that you will soon complete your term of office, I should have\nimposed upon myself this old man's journey; no Scylla or Charybdis or their storied straits could\nhave frightened me away. I should not only have crossed over, but should have been willing to swim\nover those waters, provided that I could greet you and judge in your presence how much you had\ngrown in spirit.", "Your desire, however, that I should dispatch to you my own writings does not make me think myself\nlearned, any more than a request for my picture would flatter my beauty. I know that it is due to your\ncharity rather than to your judgment. And even if it is the result of judgment, it was charity that forced\nthe judgment upon you. But whatever the quality of my works may be, read them as if I were still\nseeking, and were not aware of, the truth, and were seeking it obstinately, too. For I have sold\nmyself to no man; I bear the name of no master. I give much credit to the judgment of great men;\nbut I claim something also for my own. For these men, too, have left to us, not positive discoveries,\nbut problems whose solution is still to be sought. They might perhaps have discovered the\nessentials, had they not sought the superfluous also. They lost much time in quibbling about words\nand in sophistical argumentation; all that sort of thing exercises the wit to no purpose. We tie knots\nand bind up words in double meanings, and then try to untie them.", "Have we leisure enough for this? Do we already know how to live, or die? We should rather proceed\nwith our whole souls towards the point where it is our duty to take heed lest things, as well as words,\ndeceive us. Why, pray, do you discriminate between similar words, when nobody is ever deceived\nby them except during the discussion? It is things that lead us astray: it is between things that you\nmust discriminate. We embrace evil instead of good; we pray for something opposite to that which\nwe have prayed for in the past. Our prayers clash with our prayers, our plans with our plans. How\nclosely flattery resembles friendship! It not only apes friendship, but outdoes it, passing it in the race;\nwith wide-open and indulgent ears it is welcomed and sinks to the depths of the heart, and it is\npleasing precisely wherein it does harm. Show me how I may be able to see through this\nresemblance! An enemy comes to me full of compliments, in the guise of a friend. Vices creep into\nour hearts under the name of virtues, rashness lurks beneath the appellation of bravery, moderation\nis called sluggishness, and the coward is regarded as prudent; there is great danger if we go astray\nin these matters. So stamp them with special labels.", "Then, too, the man who is asked whether he has horns on his head is not such a fool as to feel for\nthem on his forehead, nor again so silly or dense that you can persuade him by means of\nargumentation, no matter how subtle, that he does not know the facts. Such quibbles are just as\nharmlessly deceptive as the juggler's cup and dice, in which it is the very trickery that pleases me.\nBut show me how the trick is done, and I have lost my interest therein. And I hold the same opinion\nabout these tricky word-plays; for by what other name can one call such sophistries? Not to know\nthem does no harm, and mastering them does no good. At any rate, if you wish to sift doubtful\nmeanings of this kind, teach us that the happy man is not he whom the crowd deems happy,\nnamely, he into whose coffers mighty sums have flowed, but he whose possessions are all in his\nsoul, who is upright and exalted, who spurns inconstancy, who sees no man with whom he wishes\nto change places, who rates men only at their value as men, who takes Nature for his teacher,\nconforming to her laws and living as she commands, whom no violence can deprive of his\npossessions, who turns evil into good, is unerring in judgment, unshaken, unafraid, who may be\nmoved by force but never moved to distraction, whom Fortune when she hurls at him with all her\nmight the deadliest missile in her armoury, may graze, though rarely, but never wound. For\nFortune's other missiles, with which she vanquishes mankind in general, rebound from such a one,\nlike hail which rattles on the roof with no harm to the dweller therein, and then melts away.", "Why do you bore me with that which you yourself call the \"liar\" fallacy, about which so many books\nhave been written? Come now, suppose that my whole life is a lie; prove that to be wrong and, if you\nare sharp enough, bring that back to the truth. At present it holds things to be essential of which the\ngreater part is superfluous. And even that which is not superfluous is of no significance in respect to\nits power of making one fortunate and blest. For if a thing be necessary, it does not follow that it is a\ngood. Else we degrade the meaning of \"good,\" if we apply that name to bread and barley-porridge\nand other commodities without which we cannot live. The good must in every case be necessary;\nbut that which is necessary is not in every case a good, since certain very paltry things are indeed\nnecessary.

Consider individuals, survey men in general; there is none\nwhose life does not look forward to the morrow. \"What harm is there in this,\" you ask? Infinite harm;\nfor such persons do not live, but are preparing to live. They postpone everything. Even if we paid\nstrict attention, life would soon get ahead of us; but as we are now, life finds us lingering and passes\nus by as if it belonged to another, and though it ends on the final day, it perishes every day.", "But I must not exceed the bounds of a letter, which ought not to fill the reader's left hand.

But why should\nthey think it degrading? It is only because purse-proud etiquette surrounds a householder at his\ndinner with a mob of standing slaves. The master eats more than he can hold, and with monstrous\ngreed loads his belly until it is stretched and at length ceases to do the work of a belly; so that he is\nat greater pains to discharge all the food than he was to stuff it down. All this time the poor slaves\nmay not move their lips, even to speak. The slightest murmur is repressed by the rod; even a\nchance sound, ? a cough, a sneeze, or a hiccup, ? is visited with the lash. There is a grievous\npenalty for the slightest breach of silence.

But the slaves of former days, who were permitted to converse not only in their master's\npresence, but actually with him, whose mouths were not stitched up tight, were ready to bare their\nnecks for their master, to bring upon their own heads any danger that threatened him; they spoke at\nthe feast, but kept silence during torture. Finally, the saying, in allusion to this same high-handed\ntreatment, becomes current: \"As many enemies as you have slaves.\" They are not enemies when\nwe acquire them; we make them enemies.", "I shall pass over other cruel and inhuman conduct towards them; for we maltreat them, not as if they\nwere men, but as if they were beasts of burden. When we recline at a banquet, one slave mops up\nthe disgorged food, another crouches beneath the table and gathers up the left-overs of the tipsy\nguests. Another carves the priceless game birds; with unerring strokes and skilled hand he cuts\nchoice morsels along the breast or the rump. Hapless fellow, to live only for the purpose of cutting\nfat capons correctly, ? unless, indeed, the other man is still more unhappy than he, who teaches this\nart for pleasure's sake, rather than he who learns it because he must.

Another, whose duty it is to put a valuation on the\nguests, must stick to his task, poor fellow, and watch to see whose flattery and whose immodesty,\nwhether of appetite or of language, is to get them an invitation for to-morrow. Think also of the poor\npurveyors of food, who note their masters' tastes with delicate skill, who know what special flavours\nwill sharpen their appetite, what will please their eyes, what new combinations will rouse their cloyed\nstomachs, what food will excite their loathing through sheer satiety, and what will stir them to hunger\non that particular day.

I know that at this point all the exquisites will cry out against me in a body; they will say:\n\"There is nothing more debasing, more disgraceful, than this.\" But these are the very persons whom\nI sometimes surprise kissing the hands of other men's slaves. Do you not see even this, ? how our\nancestors removed from masters everything invidious, and from slaves everything insulting? They\ncalled the master \"father of the household,\" and the slaves \"members of the household,\" a custom\nwhich still holds in the mime. They established a holiday on which masters and slaves should eat\ntogether, ? not as the only day for this custom, but as obligatory on that day in any case. They\nallowed the slaves to attain honours in the household and to pronounce judgment; they held that a\nhousehold was a miniature commonwealth.", "\"Do you mean to say,\" comes the retort, \"that I must seat all my slaves at my own table?\" No, not\nany more than that you should invite all free men to it. You are mistaken if you think that I would bar\nfrom my table certain slaves whose duties are more humble, as, for example, yonder muleteer or\nyonder herdsman; I propose to value them according to their character, and not according to their\nduties. Each man acquires his character for himself, but accident assigns his duties. Invite some to\nyour table because they deserve the honour, and others that they may come to deserve it. For if\nthere is any slavish quality in them as the result of their low associations, it will be shaken off by\nintercourse with men of gentler breeding. You need not, my dear Lucilius, hunt for friends only in the\nforum or in the Senate-house; if you are careful and attentive, you will find them at home also. Good\nmaterial often stands idle for want of an artist; make the experiment, and you will find it so. As he is\na fool who, when purchasing a horse, does not consider the animal's points, but merely his saddle\nand bridle; so he is doubly a fool who values a man from his clothes or from his rank, which indeed\nis only a robe that clothes us.", "Occupy thyself with few things, says the philosopher, if thou wouldst be tranquil.- But consider if it\nwould not be better to say, Do what is necessary, and whatever the reason of the animal which is\nnaturally social requires, and as it requires. For this brings not only the tranquility which comes from\ndoing well, but also that which comes from doing few things. For the greatest part of what we say\nand do being unnecessary, if a man takes this away, he will have more leisure and less uneasiness.\nAccordingly on every occasion a man should ask himself, Is this one of the unnecessary things?\nNow a man should take away not only unnecessary acts, but also, unnecessary thoughts, for thus\nsuperfluous acts will not follow after.", "\"He is a slave.\" His soul, however, may be that of a freeman. \"He is a slave.\" But shall that stand in\nhis way? Show me a man who is not a slave; one is a slave to lust, another to greed, another to\nambition, and all men are slaves to fear. I will name you an ex-consul who is slave to an old hag, a\nmillionaire who is slave to a serving-maid; I will show you youths of the noblest birth in serfdom to\npantomime players! No servitude is more disgraceful than that which is self-imposed.", "You should therefore not be deterred by these finicky persons from showing yourself to your slaves\nas an affable person and not proudly superior to them; they ought to respect you rather than fear\nyou. Some may maintain that I am now offering the liberty-cap to slaves in general and toppling\ndown lords from their high estate, because I bid slaves respect their masters instead of fearing\nthem. They say: \"This is what he plainly means: slaves are to pay respect as if they were clients or\nearly-morning callers!\" Anyone who holds this opinion forgets that what is enough for a god cannot\nbe too little for a master. Respect means love, and love and fear cannot be mingled. So I hold that\nyou are entirely right in not wishing to be feared by your slaves, and in lashing them merely with the\ntongue; only dumb animals need the thong.", "That which annoys us does not necessarily injure us; but we are driven into wild rage by our\nluxurious lives, so that whatever does not answer our whims arouses our anger. We don the temper\nof kings. For they, too, forgetful alike of their own strength and of other men's weakness, grow\nwhite-hot with rage, as if they had received an injury, when they are entirely protected from danger\nof such injury by their exalted station. They are not unaware that this is true, but by finding fault they\nseize upon opportunities to do harm; they insist that they have received injuries, in order that they\nmay inflict them.", "I do not wish to delay you longer; for you need no exhortation. This, among other things, is a mark of\ngood character: it forms its own judgments and abides by them; but badness is fickle and frequently\nchanging, not for the better, but for something different. Farewell.", "In answer to the letter which you wrote me while travelling, ? a letter as long as the journey itself, ? I\nshall reply later. I ought to go into retirement, and consider what sort of advice I should give you. For\nyou yourself, who consult me, also reflected for a long time whether to do so; how much more, then,\nshould I myself reflect, since more deliberation is necessary in settling than in propounding a\nproblem! And this is particularly true when one thing is advantageous to you and another to me. Am\nI speaking again in the guise of an Epicurean? But the fact is, the same thing is advantageous to me\nwhich is advantageous to you; for I am not your friend unless whatever is at issue concerning you is\nmy concern also. Friendship produces between us a partnership in all our interests. There is no\nsuch thing as good or bad fortune for the individual; we live in common. And no one can live happily\nwho has regard to himself alone and transforms everything into a question of his own utility; you\nmust live for your neighbour, if you would live for yourself. This fellowship, maintained with\nscrupulous care, which makes us mingle as men with our fellow-men and holds that the human race\nhave certain rights in common, is also of great help in cherishing the more intimate fellowship which\nis based on friendship, concerning which I began to speak above. For he that has much in common\nwith a fellow-man will have all things in common with a friend.", "And on this point, my excellent Lucilius, I should like to have those subtle dialecticians of yours\nadvise me how I ought to help a friend, or how a fellow-man, rather than tell me in how many ways\nthe word \"friend\" is used, and how many meanings the word \"man\" possesses. Lo, Wisdom and\nFolly are taking opposite sides. Which shall I join? Which party would you have me follow? On that\nside, \"man\" is the equivalent of \"friend\"; on the other side, \"friend\" is not the equivalent of \"man.\"\nThe one wants a friend for his own advantage; the other wants to make himself an advantage to his\nfriend. What you have to offer me is nothing but distortion of words and splitting of syllables. It is\nclear that unless I can devise some very tricky premisses and by false deductions tack on to them a\nfallacy which springs from the truth, I shall not be able to distinguish between what is desirable and\nwhat is to be avoided! I am ashamed! Old men as we are, dealing with a problem so serious, we\nmake play of it!", "\"'Mouse' is a syllable. Now a mouse eats cheese; therefore, a syllable eats cheese.\" Suppose now\nthat I cannot solve this problem; see what peril hangs over my head as a result of such ignorance!\nWhat a scrape I shall be in! Without doubt I must beware, or some day I shall be catching syllables\nin a mousetrap, or, if I grow careless, a book may devour my cheese! Unless, perhaps, the following\nsyllogism is shrewder still: \"'Mouse' is a syllable. Now a syllable does not eat cheese. Therefore a\nmouse does not eat cheese.\" What childish nonsense! Do we knit our brows over this sort of\nproblem? Do we let our beards grow long for this reason? Is this the matter which we teach with\nsour and pale faces?", "Would you really know what philosophy offers to humanity? Philosophy offers counsel. Death calls\naway one man, and poverty chafes another; a third is worried either by his neighbour's wealth or by\nhis own. So-and-so is afraid of bad luck; another desires to get away from his own good fortune.\nSome are ill-treated by men, others by the gods. Why, then, do you frame for me such games as\nthese? It is no occasion for jest; you are retained as counsel for unhappy mankind. You have\npromised to help those in peril by sea, those in captivity, the sick and the needy, and those whose\nheads are under the poised axe. Whither are you straying? What are you doing?", "This friend, in whose company you are jesting, is in fear. Help him, and take the noose from about\nhis neck. Men are stretching out imploring hands to you on all sides; lives ruined and in danger of\nruin are begging for some assistance; men's hopes, men's resources, depend upon you. They ask\nthat you deliver them from all their restlessness, that you reveal to them, scattered and wandering\nas they are, the clear light of truth. Tell them what nature has made necessary, and what\nsuperfluous; tell them how simple are the laws that she has laid down, how pleasant and unimpeded\nlife is for those who follow these laws, but how bitter and perplexed it is for those who have put their\ntrust in opinion rather than in nature.", "I should deem your games of logic to be of some avail in relieving men's burdens, if you could first\nshow me what part of these burdens they will relieve. What among these games of yours banishes\nlust? Or controls it? Would that I could say that they were merely of no profit! They are positively\nharmful. I can make it perfectly clear to you whenever you wish, that a noble spirit when involved in\nsuch subtleties is impaired and weakened. I am ashamed to say what weapons they supply to men\nwho are destined to go to war with fortune, and how poorly they equip them! Is this the path to the\ngreatest good? Is philosophy to proceed by such claptrap and by quibbles which would be a\ndisgrace and a reproach even for expounders of the law? For what else is it that you men are doing,\nwhen you deliberately ensnare the person to whom you are putting questions, than making it appear\nthat the man has lost his case on a technical error? But just as the judge can reinstate those who\nhave lost a suit in this way, so philosophy has reinstated these victims of quibbling to their former\ncondition. Why do you men abandon your mighty promises, and, after having assured me in\nhigh-sounding language that you will permit the glitter of gold to dazzle my eyesight no more than\nthe gleam of the sword, and that I shall, with mighty steadfastness, spurn both that which all men\ncrave and that which all men fear, why do you descend to the ABC's of scholastic pedants? What is\nyour answer?", "Try how the life of the good man suits thee, the life of him who is satisfied with his portion out of the\nwhole, and satisfied with his own just acts and benevolent disposition.", "For that is exactly what philosophy promises to me, that I shall be made equal to God. For this I\nhave been summoned, for this purpose have I come. Philosophy, keep your promise!", "Therefore, my dear Lucilius, withdraw yourself as far as possible from these exceptions and\nobjections of so-called philosophers. Frankness, and simplicity beseem true goodness. Even if there\nwere many years left to you, you would have had to spend them frugally in order to have enough for\nthe necessary things; but as it is, when your time is so scant, what madness it is to learn superfluous\nthings! Farewell.", "A man is indeed lazy and careless, my dear Lucilius, if he is reminded of a friend only by seeing\nsome landscape which stirs the memory; and yet there are times when the old familiar haunts stir up\na sense of loss that has been stored away in the soul, not bringing back dead memories, but rousing\nthem from their dormant state, just as the sight of a lost friend's favourite slave, or his cloak, or his\nhouse, renews the mourner's grief, even though it has been softened by time.", "Now, lo and behold, Campania, and especially Naples and your beloved Pompeii, struck me, when I\nviewed them, with a wonderfully fresh sense of longing for you. You stand in full view before my\neyes. I am on the point of parting from you. I see you choking down your tears and resisting without\nsuccess the emotions that well up at the very moment when you try to check them. I seem to have\nlost you but a moment ago. For what is not \"but a moment ago\" when one begins to use the\nmemory? It was but a moment ago that I sat, as a lad, in the school of the philosopher Sotion, but a\nmoment ago that I began to plead in the courts, but a moment ago that I lost the desire to plead, but\na moment ago that I lost the ability. Infinitely swift is the flight of time, as those see more clearly who\nare looking backwards. For when we are intent on the present, we do not notice it, so gentle is the\npassage of time's headlong flight. Do you ask the reason for this? All past time is in the same place;\nit all presents the same aspect to us, it lies together. Everything slips into the same abyss. Besides,\nan event which in its entirety is of brief compass cannot contain long intervals. The time which we\nspend in living is but a point, nay, even less than a point. But this point of time, infinitesimal as it is,\nnature has mocked by making it seem outwardly of longer duration; she has taken one portion\nthereof and made it infancy, another childhood, another youth, another the gradual slope, so to\nspeak, from youth to old age, and old age itself is still another. How many steps for how short a\nclimb! It was but a moment ago that I saw you off on your journey; and yet this \"moment ago\" makes\nup a goodly share of our existence, which is so brief, we should reflect, that it will soon come to an\nend altogether. In other years time did not seem to me to go so swiftly; now, it seems fast beyond\nbelief, perhaps, because I feel that the finish-line is moving closer to me, or it may be that I have\nbegun to take heed and reckon up my losses.", "For this reason I am all the more angry that some men claim the major portion of this time for\nsuperfluous things, ? time which, no matter how carefully it is guarded, cannot suffice even for\nnecessary things. Cicero declared that if the number of his days were doubled, he should not have\ntime to read the lyric poets. And you may rate the dialecticians in the same class; but they are\nfoolish in a more melancholy way. The lyric poets are avowedly frivolous; but the dialecticians\nbelieve that they are themselves engaged upon serious business. I do not deny that one must cast a\nglance at dialectic; but it ought to be a mere glance, a sort of greeting from the threshold, merely\nthat one may not be deceived, or judge these pursuits to contain any hidden matters of great worth.", "Why do you torment yourself and lose weight over some problem which it is more clever to have\nscorned than to solve? When a soldier is undisturbed and travelling at his ease, he can hunt for\ntrifles along his way; but when the enemy is closing in on the rear, and a command is given to\nquicken the pace, necessity makes him throw away everything which he picked up in moments of\npeace and leisure. I have no time to investigate disputed inflections of words, or to try my cunning\nupon them.", "Behold the gathering clans, the fast-shut gates,\nAnd weapons whetted ready for the war.", "I need a stout heart to hear without flinching this din of battle which sounds round about. And all\nwould rightly think me mad if, when greybeards and women were heaping up rocks for the\nfortifications, when the armour-clad youths inside the gates were awaiting, or even demanding, the\norder for a sally, when the spears of the foemen were quivering in our gates and the very ground\nwas rocking with mines and subterranean passages, ? I say, they would rightly think me mad if I\nwere to sit idle, putting such petty posers as this: \"What you have not lost, you have. But you have\nnot lost any horns. Therefore, you have horns,\" or other tricks constructed after the model of this\npiece of sheer silliness. And yet I may well seem in your eyes no less mad, if I spend my energies\non that sort of thing; for even now I am in a state of siege. And yet, in the former case it would be\nmerely a peril from the outside that threatened me, and a wall that sundered me from the foe; as it is\nnow, death-dealing perils are in my very presence. I have no time for such nonsense; a mighty\nundertaking is on my hands. What am I to do? Death is on my trail, and life is fleeting away; teach\nme something with which to face these troubles. Bring it to pass that I shall cease trying to escape\nfrom death, and that life may cease to escape from me. Give me courage to meet hardships; make\nme calm in the face of the unavoidable. Relax the straitened limits of the time which is allotted me.\nShow me that the good in life does not depend upon life's length, but upon the use we make of it;\nalso, that it is possible, or rather usual, for a man who has lived long to have lived too little. Say to\nme when I lie down to sleep: \"You may not wake again!\" And when I have waked: \"You may not go\nto sleep again!\" Say to me when I go forth from my house: \"You may not return!\" And when I return:\n\"You may never go forth again!\" You are mistaken if you think that only on an ocean voyage there is\na very slight space between life and death. No, the distance between is just as narrow everywhere.\nIt is not everywhere that death shows himself so near at hand; yet everywhere he is as near at\nhand.", "Rid me of these shadowy terrors; then you will more easily deliver to me the instruction for which I\nhave prepared myself.

She\nkeeps asking her attendant to change her quarters; she says that her apartments are too dark.", "You can see clearly that that which makes us smile in the case of Harpast\u00e9 happens to all the rest\nof us; nobody understands that he is himself greedy, or that he is covetous. Yet the blind ask for a\nguide, while we wander without one, saying: \"I am not self-seeking; but one cannot live at Rome in\nany other way. I am not extravagant, but mere living in the city demands a great outlay. It is not my\nfault that I have a choleric disposition, or that I have not settled down to any definite scheme of life; it\nis due to my youth.\" Why do we deceive ourselves?

At present, we do not even consult the physician, whose work would be easier if he were\ncalled in when the complaint was in its early stages. The tender and the inexperienced minds would\nfollow his advice if he pointed out the right way. No man finds it difficult to return to nature, except\nthe man who has deserted nature. We blush to receive instruction in sound sense; but, by Heaven,\nif we think it base to seek a teacher of this art, we should also abandon any hope that so great a\ngood could be instilled into us by mere chance.", "No, we must work. To tell the truth, even the work is not great, if only, as I said, we begin to mould\nand reconstruct our souls before they are hardened by sin. But I do not despair even of a hardened\nsinner. There is nothing that will not surrender to persistent treatment, to concentrated and careful\nattention; however much the timber may be bent, you can make it straight again. Heat unbends\ncurved beams, and wood that grew naturally in another shape is fashioned artificially according to\nour needs. How much more easily does the soul permit itself to be shaped, pliable as it is and more\nyielding than any liquid! For what else is the soul than air in a certain state?

There is no man to\nwhom a good mind comes before an evil one. It is the evil mind that gets first hold on all of us.\nLearning virtue means unlearning vice. We should therefore proceed to the task of freeing ourselves\nfrom faults with all the more courage because, when once committed to us, the good is an\neverlasting possession; virtue is not unlearned. For opposites find difficulty in clinging where they do\nnot belong, therefore they can be driven out and hustled away; but qualities that come to a place\nwhich is rightfully theirs abide faithfully. Virtue is according to nature; vice is opposed to it and\nhostile. But although virtues, when admitted, cannot depart and are easy to guard, yet the first steps\nin the approach to them are toilsome, because it is characteristic of a weak and diseased mind to\nfear that which is unfamiliar. The mind must, therefore, be forced to make a beginning; from then on,\nthe medicine is not bitter; for just as soon as it is curing us it begins to give pleasure. One enjoys\nother cures only after health is restored, but a draught of philosophy is at the same moment\nwholesome and pleasant. Farewell.", "Every man does the best he can, my dear Lucilius! You over there have Etna, that lofty and most\ncelebrated mountain of Sicily; (although I cannot make out why Messala, ? or was it Valgius? for I\nhave been reading in both, ? has called it \"unique,\" inasmuch as many regions belch forth fire, not\nmerely the lofty ones where the phenomenon is more frequent, ? presumably because fire rises to\nthe greatest possible height, ? but low-lying places also.) As for myself, I do the best I can; I have\nhad to be satisfied with Baiae; and I left it the day after I reached it; for Baiae is a place to be\navoided, because, though it has certain natural advantages, luxury has claimed it for her own\nexclusive resort. \"What then,\" you say, \"should any place be singled out as an object of aversion?\"\nNot at all. But just as, to the wise and upright man, one style of clothing is more suitable than\nanother, without his having an aversion for any particular colour, but because he thinks that some\ncolours do not befit one who has adopted the simple life; so there are places also, which the wise\nman or he who is on the way toward wisdom will avoid as foreign to good morals. Therefore, if he is\ncontemplating withdrawal from the world, he will not select Canopus (although Canopus does not\nkeep any man from living simply), nor Baiae either; for both places have begun to be resorts of vice.\nAt Canopus luxury pampers itself to the utmost degree; at Baiae it is even more lax, as if the place\nitself demanded a certain amount of licence.", "We ought to select abodes which are wholesome not only for the body but also for the character.\nJust as I do not care to live in a place of torture, neither do I care to live in a caf\u00e9.

We ought\nto see to it that we flee to the greatest possible distance from provocations to vice. We should\ntoughen our minds, and remove them far from the allurements of pleasure. A single winter relaxed\nHannibal's fibre; his pampering in Campania took the vigour out of that hero who had triumphed\nover Alpine snows. He conquered with his weapons, but was conquered by his vices. We too have a\nwar to wage, a type of warfare in which there is allowed no rest or furlough. To be conquered, in the\nfirst place, are pleasures, which, as you see, have carried off even the sternest characters. If a man\nhas once understood how great is the task which he has entered upon, he will see that there must\nbe no dainty or effeminate conduct. What have I to do with those hot baths or with the\nsweating-room where they shut in the dry steam which is to drain your strength? Perspiration should\nflow only after toil.", "Suppose we do what Hannibal did, ? check the course of events, give up the war, and give over our\nbodies to be coddled. Every one would rightly blame us for our untimely sloth, a thing fraught with\nperil even for the victor, to say nothing of one who is only on the way to victory. And we have even\nless right to do this than those followers of the Carthaginian flag; for our danger is greater than theirs\nif we slacken, and our toil is greater than theirs even if we press ahead. Fortune is fighting against\nme, and I shall not carry out her commands. I refuse to submit to the yoke; nay rather, I shake off\nthe yoke that is upon me, ? an act which demands even greater courage. The soul is not to be\npampered; surrendering to pleasure means also surrendering to pain, surrendering to toil,\nsurrendering to poverty. Both ambition and anger will wish to have the same rights over me as\npleasure, and I shall be torn asunder, or rather pulled to pieces, amid all these conflicting passions. I\nhave set freedom before my eyes; and I am striving for that reward. And what is freedom, you ask?\nIt means not being a slave to any circumstance, to any constraint, to any chance; it means\ncompelling Fortune to enter the lists on equal terms.

The bravest soldier comes from rock-ribbed regions; but the town-bred and the\nhome-bred are sluggish in action. The hand which turns from the plough to the sword never objects\nto toil; but your sleek and well-dressed dandy quails at the first cloud of dust. Being trained in a\nrugged country strengthens the character and fits it for great undertakings. It was more honourable\nin Scipio to spend his exile at Liternum than at Baiae; his downfall did not need a setting so\neffeminate. Those also into whose hands the rising fortunes of Rome first transferred the wealth of\nthe state, Gaius Marius, Gnaeus Pompey, and Caesar, did indeed build villas near Baiae; but they\nset them on the very tops of the mountains. This seemed more soldier-like, to look down from a lofty\nheight upon lands spread far and wide below.

Again, he says, there are others who need\noutside help, who will not proceed unless someone leads the way, but who will follow faithfully. Of\nthese, he says, Metrodorus was one; this type of man is also excellent, but belongs to the second\ngrade. We ourselves are not of that first class, either; we shall be well treated if we are admitted into\nthe second. Nor need you despise a man who can gain salvation only with the assistance of\nanother; the will to be saved means a great deal, too.", "You will find still another class of man, ? and a class not to be despised, ? who can be forced and\ndriven into righteousness, who do not need a guide as much as they require someone to encourage\nand, as it were, to force them along. This is the third variety. If you ask me for a man of this pattern\nalso, Epicurus tells us that Hermarchus was such. And of the two last-named classes, he is more\nready to congratulate the one, but he feels more respect for the other; for although both reached the\nsame goal, it is a greater credit to have brought about the same result with the more difficult material\nupon which to work.", "Suppose that two buildings have been erected, unlike as to their foundations, but equal in height\nand in grandeur. One is built on faultless ground, and the process of erection goes right ahead. In\nthe other case, the foundations have exhausted the building materials, for they have been sunk into\nsoft and shifting ground and much labour has been wasted in reaching the solid rock. As one looks\nat both of them, one sees clearly what progress the former has made, but the larger and more\ndifficult part of the latter is hidden. So with men's dispositions; some are pliable and easy to\nmanage, but others have to be laboriously wrought out by hand, so to speak, and are wholly\nemployed in the making of their own foundations. I should accordingly deem more fortunate the man\nwho has never had any trouble with himself; but the other, I feel, has deserved better of himself,\nwho has won a victory over the meanness of his own nature, and has not gently led himself, but has\nwrestled his way, to wisdom.", "You may be sure that this refractory nature, which demands much toil, has been implanted in us.\nThere are obstacles in our path; so let us fight, and call to our assistance some helpers. \"Whom,\"\nyou say, \"shall I call upon? Shall it be this man or that?\" There is another choice also open to you;\nyou may go to the ancients; for they have the time to help you. We can get assistance not only from\nthe living, but from those of the past. Let us choose, however, from among the living, not men who\npour forth their words with the greatest glibness, turning out commonplaces and holding. as it were,\ntheir own little private exhibitions, ? not these, I say, but men who teach us by their lives, men who\ntell us what we ought to do and then prove it by practice, who show us what we should avoid, and\nthen are never caught doing that which they have ordered us to avoid.", "Choose as a guide one whom you will admire more when you see him act than when you hear him\nspeak. Of course I would not prevent you from listening also to those philosophers who are wont to\nhold public meetings and discussions, provided they appear before the people for the express\npurpose of improving themselves and others, and do not practise their profession for the sake of\nself-seeking. For what is baser than philosophy courting applause? Does the sick man praise the\nsurgeon while he is operating? In silence and with reverent awe submit to the cure. Even though\nyou cry applause, I shall listen to your cries as if you were groaning when your sores were touched.\nDo you wish to bear witness that you are attentive, that you are stirred by the grandeur of the\nsubject? You may do this at the proper time; I shall of course allow you to pass judgment and cast a\nvote as to the better course. Pythagoras made his pupils keep silence for five years; do you think\nthat they had the right on that account to break out immediately into applause?", "How mad is he who leaves the lecture-room in a happy frame of mind simply because of applause\nfrom the ignorant! Why do you take pleasure in being praised by men whom you yourself cannot\npraise? Fabianus used to give popular talks, but his audience listened with self-control. Occasionally\na loud shout of praise would burst forth, but it was prompted by the greatness of his subject, and not\nby the sound of oratory that slipped forth pleasantly and softly. There should be a difference\nbetween the applause of the theatre and the applause of the school; and there is a certain decency\neven in bestowing praise. If you mark them carefully, all acts are always significant, and you can\ngauge character by even the most trifling signs. The lecherous man is revealed by his gait, by a\nmovement of the hand, sometimes by a single answer, by his touching his head with a finger, by the\nshifting of his eye. The scamp is shown up by his laugh; the madman by his face and general\nappearance. These qualities become known by certain marks; but you can tell the character of every\nman when you see how he gives and receives praise. The philosopher's audience, from this corner\nand that, stretch forth admiring hands, and sometimes the adoring crowd almost hang over the\nlecturer's head. But, if you really understand, that is not praise; it is merely applause. These outcries\nshould be left for the arts which aim to please the crowd; let philosophy be worshipped in silence.\nYoung men, indeed, must sometimes have free play to follow their impulses, but it should only be at\ntimes when they act from impulse, and when they cannot force themselves to be silent. Such praise\nas that gives a certain kind of encouragement to the hearers themselves, and acts as a spur to the\nyouthful mind. But let them be roused to the matter, and not to the style; otherwise, eloquence does\nthem harm, making them enamoured of itself, and not of the subject.", "I shall postpone this topic for the present; it demands a long and special investigation, to show how\nthe public should be addressed, what indulgences should be allowed to a speaker on a public\noccasion, and what should be allowed to the crowd itself in the presence of the speaker. There can\nbe no doubt that philosophy has suffered a loss, now that she has exposed her charms for sale. But\nshe can still be viewed in her sanctuary, if her exhibitor is a priest and not a pedlar. Farewell.", "You can persuade me into almost anything now, for I was recently persuaded to travel by water. We\ncast off when the sea was lazily smooth; the sky, to be sure, was heavy with nasty clouds, such as\nusually break into rain or squalls. Still, I thought that the few miles between Puteoli and your dear\nParthenope might be run off in quick time, despite the uncertain and lowering sky. So, in order to get\naway more quickly, I made straight out to sea for Nesis, with the purpose of cutting across all the\ninlets. But when we were so far out that it made little difference to me whether I returned or kept on,\nthe calm weather, which had enticed me, came to naught. The storm had not yet begun, but the\nground-swell was on, and the waves kept steadily coming faster. I began to ask the pilot to put me\nashore somewhere; he replied that the coast was rough and a bad place to land, and that in a storm\nhe feared a lee shore more than anything else. But I was suffering too grievously to think of the\ndanger, since a sluggish seasickness which brought no relief was racking me, the sort that upsets\nthe liver without clearing it. Therefore I laid down the law to my pilot, forcing him to make for the\nshore, willy-nilly. When we drew near, I did not wait for things to be done in accordance with Vergil's\norders, until", "A black character, a womanish character, a stubborn character, bestial, childish, animal, stupid,\ncounterfeit, scurrilous, fraudulent, tyrannical.", "I remembered my profession as a veteran devotee of cold water, and, clad as I was in my cloak, let\nmyself down into the sea, just as a cold-water bather should. What do you think my feelings were,\nscrambling over the rocks, searching out the path, or making one for myself? I understood that\nsailors have good reason to fear the land. It is hard to believe what I endured when I could not\nendure myself; you may be sure that the reason why Ulysses was shipwrecked on every possible\noccasion was not so much because the sea-god was angry with him from his birth; he was simply\nsubject to seasickness. And in the future I also, if I must go anywhere by sea, shall only reach my\ndestination in the twentieth year.", "When I finally calmed my stomach (for you know that one does not escape seasickness by escaping\nfrom the sea) and refreshed my body with a rubdown, I began to reflect how completely we forget or\nignore our failings, even those that affect the body, which are continually reminding us of their\nexistence, ? not to mention those which are more serious in proportion as they are more hidden. A\nslight ague deceives us; but when it has increased and a genuine fever has begun to burn, it forces\neven a hardy man, who can endure much suffering, to admit that he is ill. There is pain in the foot,\nand a tingling sensation in the joints; but we still hide the complaint and announce that we have\nsprained a joint, or else are tired from over-exercise. Then the ailment, uncertain at first, must be\ngiven a name; and when it begins to swell the ankles also, and has made both our feet \"right\" feet,\nwe are bound to confess that we have the gout. The opposite holds true of diseases of the soul; the\nworse one is, the less one perceives it. You need not be surprised, my beloved Lucilius. For he\nwhose sleep is light pursues visions during slumber, and sometimes, though asleep, is conscious\nthat he is asleep; but sound slumber annihilates our very dreams and sinks the spirit down so deep\nthat it has no perception of self. Why will no man confess his faults? Because he is still in their\ngrasp; only he who is awake can recount his dream, and similarly a confession of sin is a proof of\nsound mind.", "Let us, therefore, rouse ourselves, that we may be able to correct our mistakes. Philosophy,\nhowever, is the only power that can stir us, the only power that can shake off our deep slumber.\nDevote yourself wholly to philosophy. You are worthy of her; she is worthy of you; greet one another\nwith a loving embrace. Say farewell to all other interests with courage and frankness. Do not study\nphilosophy merely during your spare time.", "If you were ill, you would stop caring for your personal concerns, and forget your business duties;\nyou would not think highly enough of any client to take active charge of his case during a slight\nabatement of your sufferings. You would try your hardest to be rid of the illness as soon as possible.\nWhat, then? Shall you not do the same thing now? Throw aside all hindrances and give up your time\nto getting a sound mind; for no man can attain it if he is engrossed in other matters. Philosophy\nwields her own authority; she appoints her own time and does not allow it to be appointed for her.\nShe is not a thing to be followed at odd times, but a subject for daily practice; she is mistress, and\nshe commands our attendance. Alexander, when a certain state promised him a part of its territory\nand half its entire property, replied: \"I invaded Asia with the intention, not of accepting what you\nmight give, but of allowing you to keep what I might leave.\" Philosophy likewise keeps saying to all\noccupations: \"I do not intend to accept the time which you have left over, but I shall allow you to\nkeep what I myself shall leave.\"", "Turn to her, therefore, with all your soul, sit at her feet, cherish her; a great distance will then begin\nto separate you from other men. You will be far ahead of all mortals, and even the gods will not be\nfar ahead of you. Do you ask what will be the difference between yourself and the gods? They will\nlive longer. But, by my faith, it is the sign of a great artist to have confined a full likeness to the limits\nof a miniature. The wise man's life spreads out to him over as large a surface as does all eternity to\na god. There is one point in which the sage has an advantage over the god; for a god is freed from\nterrors by the bounty of nature, the wise man by his own bounty. What a wonderful privilege, to have\nthe weaknesses of a man and the serenity of a god! The power of philosophy to blunt the blows of\nchance is beyond belief. No missile can settle in her body; she is well-protected and impenetrable.\nShe spoils the force of some missiles and wards them off with the loose folds of her gown, as if they\nhad no power to harm; others she dashes aside, and hurls them back with such force that they\nrecoil upon the sender. Farewell.", "My ill-health had allowed me a long furlough, when suddenly it resumed the attack. \"What kind of\nill-health?\" you say. And you surely have a right to ask; for it is true that no kind is unknown to me.\nBut I have been consigned, so to speak, to one special ailment. I do not know why I should call it by\nits Greek name; for it is well enough described as \"shortness of breath.\" Its attack is of very brief\nduration, like that of a squall at sea; it usually ends within an hour. Who indeed could breathe his\nlast for long? I have passed through all the ills and dangers of the flesh; but nothing seems to me\nmore troublesome than this. And naturally so; for anything else may be called illness; but this is a\nsort of continued \"last gasp.\" Hence physicians call it \"practising how to die.\" For some day the\nbreath will succeed in doing what it has so often essayed. Do you think I am writing this letter in a\nmerry spirit, just because I have escaped? It would be absurd to take delight in such supposed\nrestoration to health, as it would be for a defendant to imagine that he had won his case when he\nhad succeeded in postponing his trial. Yet in the midst of my difficult breathing I never ceased to rest\nsecure in cheerful and brave thoughts.", "\"What?\" I say to myself; \"does death so often test me? Let it do so; I myself have for a long time\ntested death.\" \"When?\" you ask. Before I was born. Death is non-existence, and I know already\nwhat that means. What was before me will happen again after me. If there is any suffering in this\nstate, there must have been such suffering also in the past, before we entered the light of day. As a\nmatter of fact, however, we felt no discomfort then. And I ask you, would you not say that one was\nthe greatest of fools who believed that a lamp was worse off when it was extinguished than before it\nwas lighted? We mortals also are lighted and extinguished; the period of suffering comes in\nbetween, but on either side there is a deep peace. For, unless I am very much mistaken, my dear\nLucilius, we go astray in thinking that death only follows, when in reality it has both preceded us and\nwill in turn follow us. Whatever condition existed before our birth, is death. For what does it matter\nwhether you do not begin at all, or whether you leave off, inasmuch as the result of both these\nstates is non-existence?", "I have never ceased to encourage myself with cheering counsels of this kind, silently, of course,\nsince I had not the power to speak; then little by little this shortness of breath, already reduced to a\nsort of panting, came on at greater intervals, and then slowed down and finally stopped. Even by\nthis time, although the gasping has ceased, the breath does not come and go normally; I still feel a\nsort of hesitation and delay in breathing. Let it be as it pleases, provided there be no sigh from the\nsoul. Accept this assurance from me: I shall never be frightened when the last hour comes; I am\nalready prepared and do not plan a whole day ahead. But do you praise and imitate the man whom\nit does not irk to die, though he takes pleasure in living. For what virtue is there in going away when\nyou are thrust out? And yet there is virtue even in this: I am indeed thrust out, but it is as if I were\ngoing away willingly. For that reason the wise man can never be thrust out, because that would\nmean removal from a place which he was unwilling to leave; and the wise man does nothing\nunwillingly. He escapes necessity, because he wills to do what necessity is about to force upon him.\nFarewell.", "I have just returned from a ride in my litter; and I am as weary as if I had walked the distance,\ninstead of being seated. Even to be carried for any length of time is hard work, perhaps all the more\nso because it is an unnatural exercise; for Nature gave us legs with which to do our own walking,\nand eyes with which to do our own seeing. Our luxuries have condemned us to weakness; we have\nceased to be able to do that which we have long declined to do. Nevertheless, I found it necessary\nto give my body a shaking up, in order that the bile which had gathered in my throat, if that was my\ntrouble, might be shaken out, or, if the very breath within me had become, for some reason, too\nthick, that the jolting, which I have felt was a good thing for me, might make it thinner. So I insisted\non being carried longer than usual, along an attractive beach, which bends between Cumae and\nServilius Vatia's country-house, shut in by the sea on one side and the lake on the other, just like a\nnarrow path. It was packed firm under foot, because of a recent storm; since, as you know, the\nwaves, when they beat upon the beach hard and fast, level it out; but a continuous period of fair\nweather loosens it, when the sand, which is kept firm by the water, loses its moisture.", "As my habit is, I began to look about for something there that might be of service to me, when my\neyes fell upon the villa which had once belonged to Vatia. So this was the place where that famous\npraetorian millionaire passed his old age! He was famed for nothing else than his life of leisure, and\nhe was regarded as lucky only for that reason. For whenever men were ruined by their friendship\nwith Asinius Gallus whenever others were ruined by their hatred of Sejanus, and later by their\nintimacy with him, ? for it was no more dangerous to have offended him than to have loved him, ?\npeople used to cry out: \"O Vatia, you alone know how to live!\" But what he knew was how to hide,\nnot how to live; and it makes a great deal of difference whether your life be one of leisure or one of\nidleness. So I never drove past his country-place during Vatia's lifetime without saying to myself:\n\"Here lies Vatia!\"", "If he is a stranger to the universe who does not know what is in it, no less is he a stranger who does\nnot know what is going on in it. He is a runaway, who flies from social reason; he is blind, who shuts\nthe eyes of the understanding; he is poor, who has need of another, and has not from himself all\nthings which are useful for life. He is an abscess on the universe who withdraws and separates\nhimself from the reason of our common nature through being displeased with the things which\nhappen, for the same nature produces this, and has produced thee too: he is a piece rent asunder\nfrom the state, who tears his own soul from that of reasonable animals, which is one.", "But, my dear Lucilius, philosophy is a thing of holiness, something to be worshipped, so much so\nthat the very counterfeit pleases. For the mass of mankind consider that a person is at leisure who\nhas withdrawn from society, is free from care, self-sufficient, and lives for himself; but these\nprivileges can be the reward only of the wise man. Does he who is a victim of anxiety know how to\nlive for himself? What? Does he even know (and that is of first importance) how to live at all? For the\nman who has fled from affairs and from men, who has been banished to seclusion by the\nunhappiness which his own desires have brought upon him, who cannot see his neighbour more\nhappy than himself, who through fear has taken to concealment, like a frightened and sluggish\nanimal, ? this person is not living for himself; he is living for his belly, his sleep, and his lust, ? and\nthat is the most shameful thing in the world. He who lives for no one does not necessarily live for\nhimself. Nevertheless, there is so much in steadfastness and adherence to one's purpose that even\nsluggishness, if stubbornly maintained, assumes an air of authority with us.", "I could not describe the villa accurately; for I am familiar only with the front of the house, and with\nthe parts which are in public view and can be seen by the mere passer-by. There are two grottoes,\nwhich cost a great deal of labour, as big as the most spacious hall, made by hand. One of these\ndoes not admit the rays of the sun, while the other keeps them until the sun sets. There is also a\nstream running through a grove of plane-trees, which draws for its supply both on the sea and on\nLake Acheron; it intersects the grove just like a race-way, and is large enough to support fish,\nalthough its waters are continually being drawn off. When the sea is calm, however, they do not use\nthe stream, only touching the well-stocked waters when the storms give the fishermen a forced\nholiday. But the most convenient thing about the villa is the fact that Baiae is next door, it is free\nfrom all the inconveniences of that resort, and yet enjoys its pleasures. I myself understand these\nattractions, and I believe that it is a villa suited to every season of the year. It fronts the west wind,\nwhich it intercepts in such a way that Baiae is denied it. So it seems that Vatia was no fool when he\nselected this place as the best in which to spend his leisure when it was already unfruitful and\ndecrepit.", "The place where one lives, however, can contribute little towards tranquillity; it is the mind which\nmust make everything agreeable to itself. I have seen men despondent in a gay and lovely villa, and\nI have seen them to all appearance full of business in the midst of a solitude. For this reason you\nshould not refuse to believe that your life is well-placed merely because you are not now in\nCampania. But why are you not there? Just let your thoughts travel, even to this place. You may\nhold converse with your friends when they are absent, and indeed as often as you wish and for as\nlong as you wish. For we enjoy this, the greatest of pleasures, all the more when we are absent from\none another. For the presence of friends makes us fastidious; and because we can at any time talk\nor sit together, when once we have parted we give not a thought to those whom we have just\nbeheld. And we ought to bear the absence of friends cheerfully, just because everyone is bound to\nbe often absent from his friends even when they are present. Include among such cases, in the first\nplace, the nights spent apart, then the different engagements which each of two friends has, then\nthe private studies of each and their excursions into the country, and you will see that foreign travel\ndoes not rob us of much. A friend should be retained in the spirit; such a friend can never be absent.\nHe can see every day whomsoever he desires to see.", "I would therefore have you share your studies with me, your meals, and your walks. We should be\nliving within too narrow limits if anything were barred to our thoughts. I see you, my dear Lucilius,\nand at this very moment I hear you; I am with you to such an extent that I hesitate whether I should\nnot begin to write you notes instead of letters. Farewell.", "Beshrew me if I think anything more requisite than silence for a man who secludes himself in order\nto study! Imagine what a variety of noises reverberates about my ears! I have lodgings right over a\nbathing establishment. So picture to yourself the assortment of sounds, which are strong enough to\nmake me hate my very powers of hearing! When your strenuous gentleman, for example, is\nexercising himself by flourishing leaden weights; when he is working hard, or else pretends to be\nworking hard, I can hear him grunt; and whenever he releases his imprisoned breath, I can hear him\npanting in wheezy and high-pitched tones. Or perhaps I notice some lazy fellow, content with a\ncheap rubdown, and hear the crack of the pummeling hand on his shoulder, varying in sound\naccording as the hand is laid on flat or hollow. Then, perhaps, a professional comes along, shouting\nout the score; that is the finishing touch. Add to this the arresting of an occasional roysterer or\npickpocket, the racket of the man who always likes to hear his own voice in the bathroom, or the\nenthusiast who plunges into the swimming-tank with unconscionable noise and splashing. Besides\nall those whose voices, if nothing else, are good, imagine the hair-plucker with his penetrating, shrill\nvoice, ? for purposes of advertisement, ? continually giving it vent and never holding his tongue\nexcept when he is plucking the armpits and making his victim yell instead. Then the cake-seller with\nhis varied cries, the sausageman, the confectioner, and all the vendors of food hawking their wares,\neach with his own distinctive intonation.", "So you say: \"What iron nerves or deadened ears, you must have, if your mind can hold out amid so\nmany noises, so various and so discordant, when our friend Chrysippus is brought to his death by\nthe continual good-morrows that greet him!\" But I assure you that this racket means no more to me\nthan the sound of waves or falling water; although you will remind me that a certain tribe once\nmoved their city merely because they could not endure the din of a Nile cataract. Words seem to\ndistract me more than noises; for words demand attention, but noises merely fill the ears and beat\nupon them. Among the sounds that din round me without distracting, I include passing carriages, a\nmachinist in the same block, a saw-sharpener near by, or some fellow who is demonstrating with\nlittle pipes and flutes at the Trickling Fountain, shouting rather than singing.", "Furthermore, an intermittent noise upsets me more than a steady one. But by this time I have\ntoughened my nerves against all that sort of thing, so that I can endure even a boatswain marking\nthe time in high-pitched tones for his crew. For I force my mind to concentrate, and keep it from\nstraying to\nthings outside itself; all outdoors may be bedlam, provided that there is no disturbance within,\nprovided that fear is not wrangling with desire in my breast, provided that meanness and lavishness\nare not at odds, one harassing the other. For of what benefit is a quiet neighbourhood, if our\nemotions are in an uproar?", "This is not true; for no real rest can be found when reason has not done the lulling. Night brings our\ntroubles to the light, rather than banishes them; it merely changes the form of our worries. For even\nwhen we seek slumber, our sleepless moments are as harassing as the daytime. Real tranquillity is\nthe state reached by an unperverted mind when it is relaxed. Think of the unfortunate man who\ncourts sleep by surrendering his spacious mansion to silence, who, that his ear may be disturbed by\nno sound, bids the whole retinue of his slaves be quiet and that whoever approaches him shall walk\non tiptoe; he tosses from this side to that and seeks a fitful slumber amid his frettings! He complains\nthat he has heard sounds, when he has not heard them at all. The reason, you ask? His soul is in an\nuproar; it must be soothed, and its rebellious murmuring checked. You need not suppose that the\nsoul is at peace when the body is still. Sometimes quiet means disquiet.", "We must therefore rouse ourselves to action and busy ourselves with interests that are good, as\noften as we are in the grasp of an uncontrollable sluggishness. Great generals, when they see that\ntheir men are mutinous, check them by some sort of labour or keep them busy with small forays.\nThe much occupied man has no time for wantonness, and it is an obvious commonplace that the\nevils of leisure can be shaken off by hard work. Although people may often have thought that I\nsought seclusion because I was disgusted with politics and regretted my hapless and thankless\nposition, yet, in the retreat to which apprehension and weariness have driven me, my ambition\nsometimes develops afresh. For it is not because my ambition was rooted out that it has abated, but\nbecause it was wearied or perhaps even put out of temper by the failure of its plans. And so with\nluxury, also, which sometimes seems to have departed, and then when we have made a profession\nof frugality, begins to fret us and, amid our economies, seeks the pleasures which we have merely\nleft but not condemned. Indeed, the more stealthily it comes, the greater is its force. For all\nunconcealed vices are less serious; a disease also is farther on the road to being cured when it\nbreaks forth from concealment and manifests its power.

For if we have sincerely retired, and have\nsounded the signal for retreat, and have scorned outward attractions, then, as I remarked above, no\noutward thing will distract us; no music of men or of birds can interrupt good thoughts, when they\nhave once become steadfast and sure. The mind which starts at words or at chance sounds is\nunstable and has not yet withdrawn into itself; it contains within itself an element of anxiety and\nrooted fear,\nand this makes one a prey to care, as our Vergil says:", "I, whom of yore no dart could cause to flee,\nNor Greeks, with crowded lines of infantry.\nNow shake at every sound, and fear the air,\nBoth for my child and for the load I bear.", "This man in his first state is wise; he blenches neither at the brandished spear, nor at the clashing\narmour of the serried foe, nor at the din of the stricken city. This man in his second state lacks\nknowledge fearing for his own concerns, he pales at every sound; any cry is taken for the\nbattle-shout and overthrows him; the slightest disturbance renders him breathless with fear. It is the\nload that makes him afraid.

Farewell.", "When it was time for me to return to Naples from Baiae, I easily persuaded myself that a storm was\nraging, that I might avoid another trip by sea; and yet the road was so deep in mud, all the way, that\nI may be thought none the less to have made a voyage. On that day I had to endure the full fate of\nan athlete; the anointing with which we began was followed by the sand-sprinkle in the Naples\ntunnel. No place could be longer than that prison; nothing could be dimmer than those torches,\nwhich enabled us, not to see amid the darkness, but to see the darkness. But, even supposing that\nthere was light in the place, the dust, which is an oppressive and disagreeable thing even in the\nopen air, would destroy the light; how much worse the dust is there, where it rolls back upon itself,\nand, being shut in without ventilation, blows back in the faces of those who set it going! So we\nendured two inconveniences at the same time, and they were diametrically different: we struggled\nboth with mud and with dust on the same road and on the same day.", "The gloom, however, furnished me with some food for thought; I felt a certain mental thrill, and a\ntransformation unaccompanied by fear, due to the novelty and the unpleasantness of an unusual\noccurrence. Of course I am not speaking to you of myself at this point, because I am far from being\na perfect person, or even a man of middling qualities; I refer to one over whom fortune has lost her\ncontrol. Even such a man's mind will be smitten with a thrill and he will change colour. For there are\ncertain emotions, my dear Lucilius, which no courage can avoid; nature reminds courage how\nperishable a thing it is. And so he will contract his brow when the prospect is forbidding, will shudder\nat sudden apparitions, and will become dizzy when he stands at the edge of a high precipice and\nlooks down. This is not fear; it is a natural feeling which reason cannot rout. That is why certain\nbrave men, most willing to shed their own blood, cannot bear to see the blood of others. Some\npersons collapse and faint at the sight of a freshly inflicted wound; others are affected similarly on\nhandling or viewing an old wound which is festering. And others meet the sword-stroke more readily\nthan they see it dealt.", "Accordingly, as I said, I experienced a certain transformation, though it could not be called\nconfusion. Then at the first glimpse of restored daylight my good spirits returned without forethought\nor command. And I began to muse and think how foolish we are to fear certain objects to a greater\nor less degree, since all of them end in the same way. For what difference does it make whether a\nwatchtower or a mountain crashes down upon us? No difference at all, you will find. Nevertheless,\nthere will be some men who fear the latter mishap to a greater degree, though both accidents are\nequally deadly; so true it is that fear looks not to the effect, but to the cause of the effect. Do you\nsuppose that I am now referring to the Stoics, who hold that the soul of a man crushed by a great\nweight cannot abide, and is scattered forthwith, because it has not had a free opportunity to depart?\nThat is not what I am doing; those who think thus are, in my opinion, wrong. Just as fire cannot be\ncrushed out, since it will escape round the edges of the body which overwhelms it; just as the air\ncannot be damaged by lashes and blows, or even cut into, but flows back about the object to which\nit gives place; similarly the soul, which consists of the subtlest particles, cannot be arrested or\ndestroyed inside the body, but, by virtue of its delicate substance, it will rather escape through the\nvery object by which it is being crushed. Just as lightning, no matter how widely it strikes and\nflashes, makes its return through a narrow opening, so the soul, which is still subtler than fire, has a\nway of escape through any part of the body. We therefore come to this question, ? whether the soul\ncan be immortal. But be sure of this: if the soul survives the body after the body is crushed, the soul\ncan in no wise be crushed out, precisely because it does not perish; for the rule of immortality never\nadmits of exceptions, and nothing can harm that which is everlasting. Farewell.", "How scant of words our language is, nay, how poverty-stricken, I have not fully understood until\nto-day. We happened to be speaking of Plato, and a thousand subjects came up for discussion,\nwhich needed names and yet possessed none; and there were certain others which once\npossessed, but have since lost, their words because we were too nice about their use. But who can\nendure to be nice in the midst of poverty? There is an insect, called by the Greeks oestrus, which\ndrives cattle wild and scatters them all over their pasturing grounds; it used to be called asilus in our\nlanguage, as you may believe on the authority of Vergil:?", "Near Silarus groves, and eke Alburnus' shades\nOf green-clad oak-trees flits an insect, named\nAsilus by the Romans; in the Greek\nThe word is rendered oestrus. With a rough\nAnd strident sound it buzzes and drives wild\nThe terror-stricken herds throughout the woods.", "By which I infer that the word has gone out of use. And, not to keep you waiting too long, there were\ncertain uncompounded words current, like cernere ferro inter se, as will be proved again by Vergil:?", "Love the art, poor as it may be, which thou hast learned, and be content with it; and pass through\nthe rest of life like one who has intrusted to the gods with his whole soul all that he has, making\nthyself neither the tyrant nor the slave of any man.", "Great heroes, born in various lands, had come\nTo settle matters mutually with the sword.", "This \"settling matters\" we now express by decernere. The plain word has become obsolete. The\nancients used to say iusso, instead of iussero, in conditional clauses. You need not take my word,\nbut you may turn again to Vergil:?", "The other soldiers shall conduct the fight\nWith me, where I shall bid.", "It is not in my purpose to show, by this array of examples, how much time I have wasted on the\nstudy of language; I merely wish you to understand how many words, that were current in the works\nof Ennius and Accius, have become mouldy with age; while even in the case of Vergil, whose works\nare explored daily, some of his words have been filched away from us.", "You will say, I suppose: \"What is the purpose and meaning of this preamble?\" I shall not keep\nyou in the dark; I desire, if possible, to say the word essentia to you and obtain a favourable hearing.\nIf I cannot do this, I shall risk it even though it put you out of humour. I have Cicero, as authority for\nthe use of this word, and I regard him as a powerful authority. If you desire testimony of a later date,\nI shall cite Fabianus, careful of speech, cultivated, and so polished in style that he will suit even our\nnice tastes. For what can we do, my dear Lucilius? How otherwise can we find a word for that which\nthe Greeks call ?????, something that is indispensable, something that is the natural substratum of\neverything? I beg you accordingly to allow me to use this word essentia. I shall nevertheless take\npains to exercise the privilege, which you have granted me, with as sparing a hand as possible;\nperhaps I shall be content with the mere right. Yet what good will your indulgence do me, if, lo and\nbehold, I can in no wise express in Latin the meaning of the word which gave me the opportunity to\nrail at the poverty of our language? And you will condemn our narrow Roman limits even more,\nwhen you find out that there is a word of one syllable which I cannot translate. \"What is this?\" you\nask. It is the word ??. You think me lacking in facility; you believe that the word is ready to hand, that\nit might be translated by quod est. I notice, however, a great difference; you are forcing me to render\na noun by a verb. But if I must do so, I shall render it by quod est. There are six ways in which Plato\nexpresses this idea, according to a friend of ours, a man of great learning, who mentioned the fact\nto-day. And I shall explain all of them to you, if I may first point out that there is something called\ngenus and something called species.", "For the present, however, we are seeking the primary idea of genus, on which the others, the\ndifferent species, depend, which is the source of all classification, the term under which universal\nideas are embraced. And the idea of genus will be reached if we begin to reckon back from\nparticulars; for in this way we shall be conducted back to the primary notion. Now \"man\" is a\nspecies, as Aristotle says; so is \"horse,\" or \"dog.\" We must therefore discover some common bond\nfor all these terms, one which embraces them and holds them subordinate to itself. And what is this?\nIt is \"animal.\" And so there begins to be a genus \"animal,\" including all these terms, \"man,\" \"horse,\"\nand \"dog.\" But there are certain things which have life (anima) and yet are not \"animals.\" For it is\nagreed that plants and trees possess life, and that is why we speak of them as living and dying.\nTherefore the term \"living things\" will occupy a still higher place, because both animals and plants\nare included in this category. Certain objects, however, lack life, ? such as rocks. There will\ntherefore be another term to take precedence over \"living things,\" and that is \"substance.\" I shall\nclassify \"substance\" by saying that all substances are either animate or inanimate. But there is still\nsomething superior to \"substance\"; for we speak of certain things as possessing substance, and\ncertain things as lacking substance. What, then, will be the term from which these things are\nderived? It is that to which we lately gave an inappropriate name, \"that which exists.\" For by using\nthis term they will be divided into species, so that we can say: that which exists either possesses, or\nlacks, substance.", "This, therefore, is what genus is, ? the primary, original, and (to play upon the word) \"general.\" Of\ncourse there are the other genera: but they are \"special\" genera: \"man\" being, for example, a genus.\nFor \"man\" comprises species: by nations, ? Greek, Roman, Parthian; by colours, ? white, black,\nyellow. The term comprises individuals also: Cato, Cicero, Lucretius. So \"man\" falls into the category\ngenus, in so far as it includes many kinds; but in so far as it is subordinate to another term, it falls\ninto the category species. But the genus \"that which exists\" is general, and has no term superior to\nit. It is the first term in the classification of things, and all things are included under it.", "The Stoics would set ahead of this still another genus, even more primary; concerning which I shall\nimmediately speak, after proving that the genus which has been discussed above, has rightly been\nplaced first, being, as it is, capable of including everything. I therefore distribute \"that which exists\"\ninto these two species, ? things with, and things without, substance. There is no third class. And\nhow do I distribute \"substance\"? By saying that it is either animate or inanimate. And how do I\ndistribute the \"animate\"? By saying: \"Certain things have mind, while others have only life.\" Or the\nidea may be expressed as follows: \"Certain things have the power of movement, of progress, of\nchange of position, while others are rooted in the ground; they are fed and they grow only through\ntheir roots.\" Again, into what species do I divide \"animals\"? They are either perishable or\nimperishable. Certain of the Stoics regard the primary genus as the \"something.\" I shall add the\nreasons they give for their belief; they say: \"in the order of nature some things exist, and other things\ndo not exist. And even the things that do not exist are really part of the order of nature. What these\nare will readily occur to the mind, for example centaurs, giants, and all other figments of unsound\nreasoning, which have begun to have a definite shape, although they have no bodily consistency.\"", "But I now return to the subject which I promised to discuss for you, namely, how it is that Plato\ndivides all existing things in six different ways. The first class of \"that which exists\" cannot be\ngrasped by the sight or by the touch, or by any of the senses; but it can be grasped by the thought.\nAny generic conception, such as the generic idea \"man,\" does not come within the range of the\neyes; but \"man\" in particular does; as, for example, Cicero, Cato. The term \"animal\" is not seen; it is\ngrasped by thought alone. A particular animal, however, is seen, for example, a horse, a dog.", "The second class of \"things which exist,\" according to Plato, is that which is prominent and stands\nout above everything else; this, he says, exists in a pre-eminent degree. The word \"poet\" is used\nindiscriminately, for this term is applied to all writers of verse; but among the Greeks it has come to\nbe the distinguishing mark of a single individual. You know that Homer is meant when you hear men\nsay \"the poet.\" What, then, is this pre-eminent Being? God, surely, one who is greater and more\npowerful than anyone else.", "Consider, for example, the times of Vespasian. Thou wilt see all these things, people marrying,\nbringing up children, sick, dying, warring, feasting, trafficking, cultivating the ground, flattering,\nobstinately arrogant, suspecting, plotting, wishing for some to die, grumbling about the present,\nloving, heaping up treasure, desiring counsulship, kingly power. Well then, that life of these people\nno longer exists at all. Again, remove to the times of Trajan. Again, all is the same. Their life too is\ngone. In like manner view also the other epochs of time and of whole nations, and see how many\nafter great efforts soon fell and were resolved into the elements. But chiefly thou shouldst think of\nthose whom thou hast thyself known distracting themselves about idle things, neglecting to do what\nwas in accordance with their proper constitution, and to hold firmly to this and to be content with it.\nAnd herein it is necessary to remember that the attention given to everything has its proper value\nand proportion. For thus thou wilt not be dissatisfied, if thou appliest thyself to smaller matters no\nfurther than is fit.", "The third class is made up of those things which exist in the proper sense of the term; they are\ncountless in number, but are situated beyond our sight. \"What are these?\" you ask. They are Plato's\nown furniture, so to speak; he calls them \"ideas,\" and from them all visible things are created, and\naccording to their pattern all things are fashioned. They are immortal, unchangeable, inviolable. And\nthis \"idea,\" or rather, Plato's conception of it, is as follows: \"The 'idea' is the everlasting pattern of\nthose things which are created by nature.\" I shall explain this definition, in order to set the subject\nbefore you in a clearer light: Suppose that I wish to make a likeness of you; I possess in your own\nperson the pattern of this picture, wherefrom my mind receives a certain outline, which it is to\nembody in its own handiwork. That outward appearance, then, which gives me instruction and\nguidance, this pattern for me to imitate, is the \"idea.\" Such patterns, therefore, nature possesses in\ninfinite number, ? of men, fish, trees, according to whose model everything that nature has to create\nis worked out.", "In the fourth place we shall put \"form.\" And if you would know what \"form\" means, you must pay\nclose attention, calling Plato, and not me, to account for the difficulty of the subject. However, we\ncannot make fine distinctions without encountering difficulties. A moment ago I made use of the\nartist as an illustration. When the artist desired to reproduce Vergil in colours he would gaze upon\nVergil himself. The \"idea\" was Vergil's outward appearance, and this was the pattern of the intended\nwork. That which the artist draws from this \"idea\" and has embodied in his own work, is the \"form.\"\nDo you ask me where the difference lies? The former is the pattern; while the latter is the shape\ntaken from the pattern and embodied in the work. Our artist follows the one, but the other he\ncreates. A statue has a certain external appearance; this external appearance of the statue is the\n\"form.\" And the pattern itself has a certain external appearance, by gazing upon which the sculptor\nhas fashioned his statue; this is the \"idea.\" If you desire a further distinction, I will say that the \"form\"\nis in the artist's work, the \"idea\" outside his work, and not only outside it, but prior to it.", "The fifth class is made up of the things which exist in the usual sense of the term. These things are\nthe first that have to do with us; here we have all such things as men, cattle, and things. In the sixth\nclass goes all that which has a fictitious existence, like void, or time.", "Whatever is concrete to the sight or touch, Plato does not include among the things which he\nbelieves to be existent in the strict sense of the term. These things are the first that have to do with\nus: here we have all such things as men, cattle, and things. For they are in a state of flux, constantly\ndiminishing or increasing. None of us is the same man in old age that he was in youth; nor the same\non the morrow as on the day preceding. Our bodies are hurried along like flowing waters; every\nvisible object accompanies time in its flight; of the things which we see, nothing is fixed. Even I\nmyself, as I comment on this change, am changed myself. This is just what Heraclitus says: \"We go\ndown twice into the same river, and yet into a different river.\" For the stream still keeps the same\nname, but the water has already flowed past. Of course this is much more evident in rivers than in\nhuman beings. Still, we mortals are also carried past in no less speedy a course; and this prompts\nme to marvel at our madness in cleaving with great affection to such a fleeting thing as the body,\nand in fearing lest some day we may die, when every instant means the death of our previous\ncondition. Will you not stop fearing lest that may happen once which really happens every day? So\nmuch for man, ? a substance that flows away and falls, exposed to every influence; but the\nuniverse, too, immortal and enduring as it is, changes and never remains the same. For though it\nhas within itself all that it has had, it has it in a different way from that in which it has had it; it keeps\nchanging its arrangement.", "\"Very well,\" say you, \"what good shall I get from all this fine reasoning?\" None, if you wish me to\nanswer your question. Nevertheless, just as an engraver rests his eyes when they have long been\nunder a strain and are weary, and calls them from their work, and \"feasts\" them, as the saying is; so\nwe at times should slacken our minds and refresh them with some sort of entertainment. But let\neven your entertainment be work; and even from these various forms of entertainment you will\nselect, if you have been watchful, something that may prove wholesome. That is my habit, Lucilius: I\ntry to extract and render useful some element from every field of thought, no matter how far\nremoved it may be from philosophy. Now what could be less likely to reform character than the\nsubjects which we have been discussing? And how can I be made a better man by the \"ideas\" of\nPlato? What can I draw from them that will put a check on my appetites? Perhaps the very thought,\nthat all these things which minister to our senses, which arouse and excite us, are by Plato denied a\nplace among the things that really exist. Such things are therefore imaginary, and though they for\nthe moment present a certain external appearance, yet they are in no case permanent or\nsubstantial; none the less, we crave them as if they were always to exist, or as if we were always to\npossess them.", "We are weak, watery beings standing in the midst of unrealities; therefore let us turn our minds to\nthe things that are everlasting. Let us look up to the ideal outlines of all things, that flit about on high,\nand to the God who moves among them and plans how he may defend from death that which he\ncould not make imperishable because its substance forbade, and so by reason may overcome the\ndefects of the body. For all things abide, not because they are everlasting, but because they are\nprotected by the care of him who governs all things; but that which was imperishable would need no\nguardian. The Master Builder keeps them safe, overcoming the weakness of their fabric by his own\npower. Let us despise everything that is so little an object of value that it makes us doubt whether it\nexists at all. Let us at the same time reflect, seeing that Providence rescues from its perils the world\nitself, which is no less mortal than we ourselves, that to some extent our petty bodies can be made\nto tarry longer upon earth by our own providence, if only we acquire the ability to control and check\nthose pleasures whereby the greater portion of mankind perishes. Plato himself, by taking pains,\nadvanced to old age. To be sure, he was the fortunate possessor of a strong and sound body (his\nvery name was given him because of his broad chest); but his strength was much impaired by sea\nvoyages and desperate adventures. Nevertheless, by frugal living, by setting a limit upon all that\nrouses the appetites, and by painstaking attention to himself, he reached that advanced age in spite\nof many hindrances. You know, I am sure, that Plato had the good fortune, thanks to his careful\nliving, to die on his birthday, after exactly completing his eighty-first year. For this reason wise men\nof the East, who happened to be in Athens at that time, sacrificed to him after his death, believing\nthat his length of days was too full for a mortal man, since he had rounded out the perfect number of\nnine times nine. I do not doubt that he would have been quite willing to forgo a few days from this\ntotal, as well as the sacrifice.", "Frugal living can bring one to old age; and to my mind old age is not to be refused any more than it\nis to be craved. There is a pleasure in being in one's own company as long as possible, when a man\nhas made himself worth enjoying. The question, therefore, on which we have to record our judgment\nis, whether one should shrink from extreme old age and should hasten the end artificially, instead of\nwaiting for it to come. A man who sluggishly awaits his fate is almost a coward, just as he is\nimmoderately given to wine who drains the jar dry and sucks up even the dregs. But we shall ask\nthis question also: \"Is the extremity of life the dregs, or is it the clearest and purest part of all,\nprovided only that the mind is unimpaired, and the senses, still sound, give their support to the spirit,\nand the body is not worn out and dead before its time?\" For it makes a great deal of difference\nwhether a man is lengthening his life or his death. But if the body is useless for service, why should\none not free the struggling soul? Perhaps one ought to do this a little before the debt is due, lest,\nwhen it falls due, he may be unable to perform the act. And since the danger of living in\nwretchedness is greater than the danger of dying soon, he is a fool who refuses to stake a little time\nand win a hazard of great gain.", "Few have lasted through extreme old age to death without impairment, and many have lain inert,\nmaking no use of themselves. How much more cruel, then, do you suppose it really is to have lost a\nportion of your life, than to have lost your right to end that life? Do not hear me with reluctance, as if\nmy statement applied directly to you, but weigh what I have to say. It is this: that I shall not abandon\nold age, if old age preserves me intact for myself, and intact as regards the better part of myself; but\nif old age begins to shatter my mind, and to pull its various faculties to pieces, if it leaves me, not life,\nbut only the breath of life, I shall rush out of a house that is crumbling and tottering. I shall not avoid\nillness by seeking death, as long as the illness is curable and does not impede my soul. I shall not\nlay violent hands upon myself just because I am in pain; for death under such circumstances is\ndefeat. But if I find out that the pain must always be endured, I shall depart, not because of the pain\nbut because it will be a hindrance to me as regards all my reasons for living. He who dies just\nbecause he is in pain is a weakling, a coward; but he who lives merely to brave out this pain, is a\nfool.", "But I am running on too long; and, besides, there is matter here to fill a day. And how can a man\nend his life, if he cannot end a letter? So farewell. This last word you will read with greater pleasure\nthan all my deadly talk about death. Farewell.", "I received great pleasure from your letter; kindly allow me to use these words in their everyday\nmeaning, without insisting upon their Stoic import. For we Stoics hold that pleasure is a vice. Very\nlikely it is a vice; but we are accustomed to use the word when we wish to indicate a happy state of\nmind. I am aware that if we test words by our formula, even pleasure is a thing of ill repute, and joy\ncan be attained only by the wise. For \"joy\" is an elation of spirit, ? of a spirit which trusts in the\ngoodness and truth of its own possessions. The common usage, however, is that we derive great\n\"joy\" from a friend's position as consul, or from his marriage, or from the birth of his child; but these\nevents, so far from being matters of joy, are more often the beginnings of sorrow to come. No, it is a\ncharacteristic of real joy that it never ceases, and never changes into its opposite.", "The words which were formerly familiar are now antiquated: so also the names of those who were\nfamed of old, are now in a manner antiquated, Camillus, Caeso, Volesus, Leonnatus, and a little\nafter also Scipio and Cato, then Augustus, then also Hadrian and Antoninus. For all things soon\npass away and become a mere tale, and complete oblivion soon buries them. And I say this of those\nwho have shone in a wondrous way. For the rest, as soon as they have breathed out their breath,\nthey are gone, and no man speaks of them. And, to conclude the matter, what is even an eternal\nremembrance? A mere nothing. What then is that about which we ought to employ our serious\npains? This one thing, thoughts just, and acts social, and words which never lie, and a disposition\nwhich gladly accepts all that happens, as necessary, as usual, as flowing from a principle and\nsource of the same kind.", "his words are eloquent, but not strictly appropriate. For no \"joy\" can be evil. He has given the name\n\"joy\" to pleasures, and has thus expressed his meaning. For he has conveyed the idea that men\ntake delight in their own evil. Nevertheless, I was not wrong in saying that I received great \"pleasure\"\nfrom your letter; for although an ignorant man may derive \"joy\" if the cause be an honourable one,\nyet, since his emotion is wayward, and is likely soon to take another direction, I call it \"pleasure\"; for\nit is inspired by an opinion concerning a spurious good; it exceeds control and is carried to excess.", "But, to return to the subject, let me tell you what delighted me in your letter. You have your words\nunder control. You are not carried away by your language, or borne beyond the limits which you\nhave determined upon. Many writers are tempted by the charm of some alluring phrase to some\ntopic\nother than that which they had set themselves to discuss. But this has not been so in your case; all\nyour words are compact, and suited to the subject, You say all that you wish, and you mean still\nmore than you say. This is a proof of the importance of your subject matter, showing that your mind,\nas well as your words, contains nothing superfluous or bombastic.", "I do, however, find some metaphors, not, indeed, daring ones, but the kind which have stood the\ntest of use. I find similes also; of course, if anyone forbids us to use them, maintaining that poets\nalone have that privilege, he has not, apparently, read any of our ancient prose writers, who had not\nyet learned to affect a style that should win applause. For those writers, whose eloquence was\nsimple and directed only towards proving their case, are full of comparisons; and I think that these\nare necessary, not for the same reason which makes them necessary for the poets, but in order that\nthey may serve as props to our feebleness, to bring both speaker and listener face to face with the\nsubject under discussion. For example, I am at this very moment reading Sextius; he is a keen man,\nand a philosopher who, though he writes in Greek, has the Roman standard of ethics. One of his\nsimiles appealed especially to me, that of an army marching in hollow square, in a place where the\nenemy might be expected to appear from any quarter, ready for battle. \"This,\" said he, \"is just what\nthe wise man ought to do; he should have all his fighting qualities deployed on every side, so that\nwherever the attack threatens, there his supports may be ready to hand and may obey the captain's\ncommand without confusion.\" This is what we notice in armies which serve under great leaders; we\nsee how all the troops simultaneously understand their general's orders, since they are so arranged\nthat a signal given by one man passes down the ranks of cavalry and infantry at the same moment.\nThis, he declares, is still more necessary for men like ourselves; for soldiers have often feared an\nenemy without reason, and the march which they thought most dangerous has in fact been most\nsecure; but folly brings no repose, fear haunts it both in the van and in the rear of the column, and\nboth flanks are in a panic. Folly is pursued, and confronted, by peril. It blenches at everything; it is\nunprepared; it is frightened even by auxiliary troops. But the wise man is fortified against all inroads;\nhe is alert; he will not retreat before the attack of poverty, or of sorrow, or of disgrace, or of pain. He\nwill walk undaunted both against them and among them.", "We human beings are fettered and weakened by many vices; we have wallowed in them for a long\ntime, and it is hard for us to be cleansed. We are not merely defiled; we are dyed by them. But, to\nrefrain from passing from one figure to another, I will raise this question, which I often consider in my\nown heart: why is it that folly holds us with such an insistent grasp? It is, primarily, because we do\nnot combat it strongly enough, because we do not struggle towards salvation with all our might;\nsecondly, because we do not put sufficient trust in the discoveries of the wise, and do not drink in\ntheir words with open hearts; we approach this great problem in too trifling a spirit. But how can a\nman learn, in the struggle against his vices, an amount that is enough, if the time which he gives to\nlearning is only the amount left over from his vices? None of us goes deep below the surface. We\nskim the top only, and we regard the smattering of time spent in the search for wisdom as enough\nand to spare for a busy man. What hinders us most of all is that we are too readily satisfied with\nourselves; if we meet with someone who calls us good men, or sensible men, or holy men, we see\nourselves in his description. Not content with praise in moderation, we accept everything that\nshameless flattery heaps upon us, as if it were our due. We agree with those who declare us to be\nthe best and wisest of men, although we know that they are given to much lying. And we are so\nself-complacent that we desire praise for certain actions when we are especially addicted to the very\nopposite. Yonder person hears himself called \"most gentle\" when he is inflicting tortures, or \"most\ngenerous\" when he is engaged in looting, or \"most temperate\" when he is in the midst of\ndrunkenness and lust. Thus it follows that we are unwilling to be reformed, just because we believe\nourselves to be the best of men.", "Alexander was roaming as far as India, ravaging tribes that were but little known, even to their\nneighbours. During the blockade of a certain city, while he was reconnoitring the walls and hunting\nfor the weakest spot in the fortifications, he was wounded by an arrow. Nevertheless, he long\ncontinued the siege, intent on finishing what he had begun. The pain of his wound, however, as the\nsurface became dry and as the flow of blood was checked, increased; his leg gradually became\nnumb as he sat his horse; and finally, when he was forced to withdraw, he exclaimed: \"All men\nswear that I am the son of Jupiter, but this wound cries out that I am mortal.\" Let us also act in the\nsame way. Each man, according to his lot in life, is stultified by flattery. We should say to him who\nflatters us: \"You call me a man of sense, but I understand how many of the things which I crave are\nuseless, and how many of the things which I desire will do me harm. I have not even the knowledge,\nwhich satiety teaches to animals, of what should be the measure of my food or my drink. I do not yet\nknow how much I can hold.\"", "I shall now show you how you may know that you are not wise. The wise man is joyful, happy and\ncalm, unshaken; he lives on a plane with the gods. Now go, question yourself; if you are never\ndowncast, if your mind is not harassed by any apprehension, through anticipation of what is to\ncome, if day and night your soul keeps on its even and unswerving course, upright and content with\nitself, then you have attained to the greatest good that mortals can possess. If, however, you seek\npleasures of all kinds in all directions, you must know that you are as far short of wisdom as you are\nshort of joy. Joy is the goal which you desire to reach, but you are wandering from the path, if you\nexpect to reach your goal while you are in the midst of riches and official titles, ? in other words, if\nyou seek joy in the midst of cares. These objects for which you strive so eagerly, as if they would\ngive you happiness and pleasure, are merely causes of grief.", "All men of this stamp, I maintain, are pressing on in pursuit of joy, but they do not know where they\nmay obtain a joy that is both great and enduring. One person seeks it in feasting and\nself-indulgence; another, in canvassing for honours and in being surrounded by a throng of clients;\nanother, in his mistress; another, in idle display of culture and in literature that has no power to heal;\nall these men are led astray by delights which are deceptive and short-lived ? like drunkenness for\nexample, which pays for a single hour of hilarious madness by a sickness of many days, or like\napplause and the popularity of enthusiastic approval which are gained, and atoned for, at the cost of\ngreat mental disquietude.", "Reflect, therefore, on this, that the effect of wisdom is a joy that is unbroken and continuous. The\nmind of the wise man is like the ultra-lunar firmament; eternal calm pervades that region. You have,\nthen, a reason for wishing to be wise, if the wise man is never deprived of joy. This joy springs only\nfrom the knowledge that you possess the virtues. None but the brave, the just, the self-restrained,\ncan rejoice. And when you query: \"What do you mean? Do not the foolish and the wicked also\nrejoice?\" I reply, no more than lions who have caught their prey. When men have wearied\nthemselves with wine and lust, when night fails them before their debauch is done, when the\npleasures which they have heaped upon a body that is too small to hold them begin to fester, at\nsuch times they utter in their wretchedness those lines of Vergil:", "Thou knowest how, amid false-glittering joys.\nWe spent that last of nights.", "Pleasure-lovers spend every night amid false-glittering joys, and just as if it were their last. But the\njoy which comes to the gods, and to those who imitate the gods, is not broken off, nor does it cease;\nbut it would surely cease were it borrowed from without. Just because it is not in the power of\nanother to bestow, neither is it subject to another's whims. That which Fortune has not given, she\ncannot take away. Farewell.", "Willingly give thyself up to Clotho, one of the Fates, allowing her to spin thy thread into whatever\nthings she pleases.", "I file a complaint, I enter a suit, I am angry. Do you still desire what your nurse, your guardian, or\nyour mother, have prayed for in your behalf? Do you not yet understand what evil they prayed for?\nAlas, how hostile to us are the wishes of our own folk! And they are all the more hostile in proportion\nas they are more completely fulfilled. It is no surprise to me, at my age, that nothing but evil attends\nus from our early youth; for we have grown up amid the curses invoked by our parents. And may the\ngods give ear to our cry also, uttered in our own behalf, ? one which asks no favours!", "How long shall we go on making demands upon the gods, as if we were still unable to support\nourselves? How long shall we continue to fill with grain the market-places of our great cities? How\nlong must the people gather it in for us? How long shall many ships convey the requisites for a\nsingle meal, bringing them from no single sea? The bull is filled when he feeds over a few acres;\nand one forest is large enough for a herd of elephants. Man, however, draws sustenance both from\nthe earth and from the sea. What, then? Did nature give us bellies so insatiable, when she gave us\nthese puny bodies, that we should outdo the hugest and most voracious animals in greed? Not at\nall. How small is the amount which will satisfy nature? A very little will send her away contented. It is\nnot the natural hunger of our bellies that costs us dear, but our solicitous cravings. Therefore those\nwho, as Sallust puts it, \"hearken to their bellies,\" should be numbered among the animals, and not\namong men; and certain men, indeed, should be numbered, not even among the animals, but\namong the dead. He really lives who is made use of by many; he really lives who makes use of\nhimself. Those men, however, who creep into a hole and grow torpid are no better off in their homes\nthan if they were in their tombs. Right there on the marble lintel of the house of such a man you may\ninscribe his name, for he has died before he is dead. Farewell.", "Let us cease to desire that which we have been desiring. I, at least, am doing this: in my old age I\nhave ceased to desire what I desired when a boy. To this single end my days and my nights are\npassed; this is my task, this the object of my thoughts, ? to put an end to my chronic ills. I am\nendeavouring to live every day as if it were a complete life. I do not indeed snatch it up as if it were\nmy last; I do regard it, however, as if it might even be my last. The present letter is written to you\nwith this in mind, ? as if death were about to call me away in the very act of writing. I am ready to\ndepart, and I shall enjoy life just because I am not over-anxious as to the future date of my\ndeparture.", "Before I became old I tried to live well; now that I am old, I shall try to die well; but dying well means\ndying gladly. See to it that you never do anything unwillingly. That which is bound to be a necessity\nif you rebel, is not a necessity if you desire it. This is what I mean: he who takes his orders gladly,\nescapes the bitterest part of slavery, ? doing what one does not want to do. The man who does\nsomething under orders is not unhappy; he is unhappy who does something against his will. Let us\ntherefore so set our minds in order that we may desire whatever is demanded of us by\ncircumstances, and above all that we may reflect upon our end without sadness. We must make\nready for death before we make ready for life. Life is well enough furnished, but we are too greedy\nwith regard to its furnishings; something always seems to us lacking, and will always seem lacking.\nTo have lived long enough depends neither upon our years nor upon our days, but upon our minds.\nI have lived, my dear friend Lucilius, long enough. I have had my fill; I await death. Farewell.", "We are deceived by those who would have us believe that a multitude of affairs blocks their pursuit\nof liberal studies; they make a pretence of their engagements, and multiply them, when their\nengagements are merely with themselves. As for me, Lucilius, my time is free; it is indeed free, and\nwherever I am, I am master of myself. For I do not surrender myself to my affairs, but loan myself to\nthem, and I do not hunt out excuses for wasting my time. And wherever I am situated, I carry on my\nown meditations and ponder in my mind some wholesome thought. When I give myself to my\nfriends, I do not withdraw from my own company, nor do I linger with those who are associated with\nme through some special occasion or some case which arises from my official position. But I spend\nmy time in the company of all the best; no matter in what lands they may have lived, or in what age,\nI let my thoughts fly to them. Demetrius, for instance, the best of men, I take about with me, and,\nleaving the wearers of purple and fine linen, I talk with him, half-naked as he is, and hold him in high\nesteem. Why should I not hold him in high esteem? I have found that he lacks nothing. It is in the\npower of any man to despise all things, but of no man to possess all things. The shortest cut to\nriches is to despise riches. Our friend Demetrius, however, lives not merely as if he has learned to\ndespise all things, but as if he has handed them over for others to possess. Farewell.", "I am grieved to hear that your friend Flaccus is dead, but I would not have you sorrow more than is\nfitting. That you should not mourn at all I shall hardly dare to insist; and yet I know that it is the better\nway. But what man will ever be so blessed with that ideal steadfastness of soul, unless he has\nalready risen far above the reach of Fortune? Even such a man will be stung by an event like this,\nbut it will be only a sting. We, however, may be forgiven for bursting into tears, if only our tears have\nnot flowed to excess, and if we have checked them by our own efforts. Let not the eyes be dry when\nwe have lost a friend, nor let them overflow. We may weep, but we must not wail.", "Do you think that the law which I lay down for you is harsh, when the greatest of Greek poets has\nextended the privilege of weeping to one day only, in the lines where he tells us that even Niobe\ntook thought of food? Do you wish to know the reason for lamentations and excessive weeping? It is\nbecause we seek the proofs of our bereavement in our tears, and do not give way to sorrow, but\nmerely parade it. No man goes into mourning for his own sake. Shame on our ill-timed folly! There is\nan element of self-seeking even in our sorrow.", "\"What,\" you say, \"am I to forget my friend?\" It is surely a short-lived memory that you vouchsafe to\nhim, if it is to endure only as long as your grief; presently that brow of yours will be smoothed out in\nlaughter by some circumstance, however casual. It is to a time no more distant than this that I put off\nthe soothing of every regret, the quieting of even the bitterest grief. As soon as you cease to\nobserve yourself, the picture of sorrow which you have contemplated will fade away; at present you\nare keeping watch over your own suffering. But even while you keep watch it slips away from you,\nand the sharper it is, the more speedily it comes to an end.", "Let us see to it that the recollection of those whom we have lost becomes a pleasant memory to us.\nNo man reverts with pleasure to any subject which he will not be able to reflect upon without pain.\nSo too it cannot but be that the names of those whom we have loved and lost come back to us with\na sort of sting; but there is a pleasure even in this sting. For, as my friend Attalus used to say: \"The\nremembrance of lost friends is pleasant in the same way that certain fruits have an agreeably acid\ntaste, or as in extremely old wines it is their very bitterness that pleases us. Indeed, after a certain\nlapse of time, every thought that gave pain is quenched, and the pleasure comes to us unalloyed.\" If\nwe take the word of Attalus for it, \"to think of friends who are alive and well is like enjoying a meal of\ncakes and honey; the recollection of friends who have passed away gives a pleasure that is not\nwithout a touch of bitterness. Yet who will deny that even these things, which are bitter and contain\nan element of sourness, do serve to arouse the stomach?\" For my part, I do not agree with him. To\nme, the thought of my dead friends is sweet and appealing. For I have had them as if I should one\nday lose them; I have lost them as if I have them still.", "Therefore, Lucilius, act as befits your own serenity of mind, and cease to put a wrong interpretation\non the gifts of Fortune. Fortune has taken away, but Fortune has given. Let us greedily enjoy our\nfriends, because we do not know how long this privilege will be ours. Let us think how often we shall\nleave them when we go upon distant journeys, and how often we shall fail to see them when we\ntarry together in the same place; we shall thus understand that we have lost too much of their time\nwhile they were alive. But will you tolerate men who are most careless of their friends, and then\nmourn them most abjectly, and do not love anyone unless they have lost him? The reason why they\nlament too unrestrainedly at such times is that they are afraid lest men doubt whether they really\nhave loved; all too late they seek for proofs of their emotions. If we have other friends, we surely\ndeserve ill at their hands and think ill of them, if they are of so little account that they fail to console\nus for the loss of one. If, on the other hand, we have no other friends, we have injured ourselves\nmore than Fortune has injured us; since Fortune has robbed us of one friend, but we have robbed\nourselves of every friend whom we have failed to make. Again, he who has been unable to love\nmore than one, has had none too much love even for that one. If a man who has lost his one and\nonly tunic through robbery chooses to bewail his plight rather than look about him for some way to\nescape the cold, or for something with which to cover his shoulders, would you not think him an utter\nfool?", "Everything is only for a day, both that which remembers and that which is remembered.", "You have buried one whom you loved; look about for someone to love. It is better to replace your\nfriend than to weep for him. What I am about to add is, I know, a very hackneyed remark, but I shall\nnot omit it simply because it is a common phrase: A man ends his grief by the mere passing of time,\neven if he has not ended it of his own accord. But the most shameful cure for sorrow, in the case of\na sensible man, is to grow weary of sorrowing. I should prefer you to abandon grief, rather than\nhave grief abandon you; and you should stop grieving as soon as possible, since, even if you wish\nto do so, it is impossible to keep it up for a long time. Our forefathers have enacted that, in the case\nof women, a year should be the limit for mourning; not that they needed to mourn for so long, but\nthat they should mourn no longer. In the case of men, no rules are laid down, because to mourn at\nall is not regarded as honourable. For all that, what woman can you show me, of all the pathetic\nfemales that could scarcely be dragged away from the funeral-pile or torn from the corpse, whose\ntears have lasted a whole month? Nothing becomes offensive so quickly as grief; when fresh, it finds\nsomeone to console it and attracts one or another to itself; but after becoming chronic, it is ridiculed,\nand rightly. For it is either assumed or foolish.", "He who writes these words to you is no other than I, who wept so excessively for my dear friend\nAnnaeus Serenus that, in spite of my wishes, I must be included among the examples of men who\nhave been overcome by grief. To-day, however, I condemn this act of mine, and I understand that\nthe reason why I lamented so greatly was chiefly that I had never imagined it possible for his death\nto precede mine. The only thought which occurred to my mind was that he was the younger, and\nmuch younger, too, ? as if the Fates kept to the order of our ages!", "Therefore let us continually think as much about our own mortality as about that of all those we love.\nIn former days I ought to have said: \"My friend Serenus is younger than I; but what does that\nmatter? He would naturally die after me, but he may precede me.\" It was just because I did not do\nthis that I was unprepared when Fortune dealt me the sudden blow. Now is the time for you to\nreflect, not only that all things are mortal, but also that their mortality is subject to no fixed law.\nWhatever can happen at any time can happen to-day. Let us therefore reflect, my beloved Lucilius,\nthat we shall soon come to the goal which this friend, to our own sorrow, has reached. And perhaps,\nif only the tale told by wise men is true and there is a bourne to welcome us, then he whom we think\nwe have lost has only been sent on ahead. Farewell.", "Yesterday you were with us. You might complain if I said \"yesterday\" merely. This is why I have\nadded \"with us.\" For, so far as I am concerned, you are always with me. Certain friends had\nhappened in, on whose account a somewhat brighter fire was laid, ? not the kind that generally\nbursts from the kitchen chimneys of the rich and scares the watch, but the moderate blaze which\nmeans that guests have come. Our talk ran on various themes, as is natural at a dinner; it pursued\nno chain of thought to the end, but jumped from one topic to another. We then had read to us a book\nby Quintus Sextius the Elder. He is a great man, if you have any confidence in my opinion, and a\nreal Stoic, though he himself denies it. Ye Gods, what strength and spirit one finds in him! This is not\nthe case with all philosophers; there are some men of illustrious name whose writings are sapless.\nThey lay down rules, they argue, and they quibble; they do not infuse spirit simply because they\nhave no spirit. But when you come to read Sextius, you will say: \"He is alive; he is strong; he is free;\nhe is more than a man; he fills me with a mighty confidence before I close his book.\" I shall\nacknowledge to you the state of mind I am in when I read his works: I want to challenge every\nhazard; I want to cry: \"Why keep me waiting, Fortune? Enter the lists! Behold, I am ready for you!\" I\nassume the spirit of a man who seeks where he may make trial of himself, where he may show his\nworth:", "And fretting 'mid the unwarlike flocks he prays\nSome foam-flecked boar may cross his path, or else\nA tawny lion stalking down the hills.", "I want something to overcome, something on which I may test my endurance. For this is another\nremarkable quality that Sextius possesses: he will show you the grandeur of the happy life and yet\nwill not make you despair of attaining it; you will understand that it is on high, but that it is accessible\nto him who has the will to seek it.", "And virtue herself will have the same effect upon you, of making you admire her and yet hope to\nattain her. In my own case, at any rate the very contemplation of wisdom takes much of my time; I\ngaze upon her with bewilderment, just as I sometimes gaze upon the firmament itself, which I often\nbehold as if I saw it for the first time. Hence I worship the discoveries of wisdom and their\ndiscoverers; to enter, as it were, into the inheritance of many predecessors is a delight. It was for me\nthat they laid up this treasure; it was for me that they toiled. But we should play the part of a careful\nhouseholder; we should increase what we have inherited. This inheritance shall pass from me to my\ndescendants larger than before. Much still remains to do, and much will always remain, and he who\nshall be born a thousand ages hence will not be barred from his opportunity of adding something\nfurther. But even if the old masters have discovered everything, one thing will be always new, ? the\napplication and the scientific study and classification of the discoveries made by others. Assume that\nprescriptions have been handed down to us for the healing of the eyes; there is no need of my\nsearching for others in addition; but for all that, these prescriptions must be adapted to the particular\ndisease and to the particular stage of the disease. Use this prescription to relieve granulation of the\neyelids, that to reduce the swelling of the lids, this to prevent sudden pain or a rush of tears, that to\nsharpen the vision. Then compound these several prescriptions, watch for the right time of their\napplication, and apply the proper treatment in each case.", "The cures for the spirit also have been discovered by the ancients; but it is our task to learn the\nmethod and the time of treatment. Our predecessors have worked much improvement, but have not\nworked out the problem. They deserve respect, however, and should be worshipped with a divine\nritual. Why should I not keep statues of great men to kindle my enthusiasm, and celebrate their\nbirthdays? Why should I not continually greet them with respect and honour? The reverence which I\nowe to my own teachers I owe in like measure to those teachers of the human race, the source from\nwhich the beginnings of such great blessings have flowed. If I meet a consul or a praetor, I shall pay\nhim all the honour which his post of honour is wont to receive: I shall dismount, uncover, and yield\nthe road. What, then? Shall I admit into my soul with less than the highest marks of respect Marcus\nCato, the Elder and the Younger, Laelius the Wise, Socrates and Plato, Zeno and Cleanthes? I\nworship them in very truth, and always rise to do honour to such noble names. Farewell.", "I shared my time yesterday with ill health; it claimed for itself all the period before noon; in the\nafternoon, however, it yielded to me. And so I first tested my spirit by reading; then, when reading\nwas found to be possible, I dared to make more demands upon the spirit, or perhaps I should say, to\nmake more concessions to it. I wrote a little, and indeed with more concentration than usual, for I am\nstruggling with a difficult subject and do not wish to be downed. In the midst of this, some friends\nvisited me, with the purpose of employing force and of restraining me, as if I were a sick man\nindulging in some excess. So conversation was substituted for writing; and from this conversation I\nshall communicate to you the topic which is still the subject of debate; for we have appointed you\nreferee. You have more of a task on your hands than you suppose, for the argument is threefold.", "Our Stoic philosophers, as you know, declare that there are two things in the universe which are the\nsource of everything, ? namely, cause and matter. Matter lies sluggish, a substance ready for any\nuse, but sure to remain unemployed if no one sets it in motion. Cause, however, by which we mean\nreason, moulds matter and turns it in whatever direction it will, producing thereby various concrete\nresults. Accordingly, there must be, in the case of each thing, that from which it is made, and, next,\nan agent by which it is made. The former is its material, the latter its cause.", "Observe constantly that all things take place by change, and accustom thyself to consider that the\nnature of the Universe loves nothing so much as to change the things which are and to make new\nthings like them. For everything that exists is in a manner the seed of that which will be. But thou art\nthinking only of seeds which are cast into the earth or into a womb: but this is a very vulgar notion.", "All art is but imitation of nature; therefore, let me apply these statements of general principles to the\nthings which have to be made by man. A statue, for example, has afforded matter which was to\nundergo treatment at the hands of the artist, and has had an artist who was to give form to the\nmatter. Hence, in the case of the statue, the material was bronze, the cause was the workman. And\nso it goes with all things, ? they consist of that which is made, and of the maker. The Stoics believe\nin one cause only, ? the maker; but Aristotle thinks that the word \"cause\" can be used in three ways:\n\"The first cause,\" he says, \"is the actual matter, without which nothing can be created. The second\nis the workman. The third is the form, which is impressed upon every work, ? a statue, for example.\"\nThis last is what Aristotle calls the idos. \"There is, too,\" says he, \"a fourth, ? the purpose of the work\nas a whole.\" Now I shall show you what this last means. Bronze is the \"first cause\" of the statue, for\nit could never have been made unless there had been something from which it could be cast and\nmoulded. The \"second cause\" is the artist; for without the skilled hands of a workman that bronze\ncould not have been shaped to the outlines of the statue. The \"third cause\" is the form, inasmuch as\nour statue could never be called The Lance-Bearer or The Boy Binding his Hair, had not this special\nshape been stamped upon it. The \"fourth cause\" is the purpose of the work. For if this purpose had\nnot existed, the statue would not have been made. Now what is this purpose? It is that which\nattracted the artist, which he followed when he made the statue. It may have been money, if he has\nmade it for sale; or renown, if he has worked for reputation; or religion, if he has wrought it as a gift\nfor a temple. Therefore this also is a cause contributing towards the making of the statue; or do you\nthink that we should avoid including, among the causes of a thing which has been made, that\nelement without which the thing in question would not have been made?", "To these four Plato adds a fifth cause, ? the pattern which he himself calls the \"idea\"; for it is this\nthat the artist gazed upon when he created the work which he had decided to carry out. Now it\nmakes no difference whether he has his pattern outside himself, that he may direct his glance to it,\nor within himself, conceived and placed there by himself. God has within himself these patterns of all\nthings, and his mind comprehends the harmonies and the measures of the whole totality of things\nwhich are to be carried out; he is filled with these shapes which Plato calls the \"ideas,\" ?\nimperishable, unchangeable, not subject to decay. And therefore, though men die, humanity itself,\nor the idea of man, according to which man is moulded, lasts on, and though men toil and perish, it\nsuffers no change. Accordingly, there are five causes, as Plato says: the material, the agent, the\nmake-up, the model, and the end in view. Last comes the result of all these. Just as in the case of\nthe statue, ? to go back to the figure with which we began, ? the material is the bronze, the agent is\nthe artist, the make-up is the form which is adapted to the material, the model is the pattern imitated\nby the agent, the end in view is the purpose in the maker's mind, and, finally, the result of all these is\nthe statue itself. The universe also, in Plato's opinion, possesses all these elements. The agent is\nGod; the source, matter; the form, the shape and the arrangement of the visible world. The pattern\nis doubtless the model according to which God has made this great and most beautiful\ncreation. The purpose is his object in so doing. Do you ask what God's purpose is? It is goodness.\nPlato, at any rate, says: \"What was God's reason for creating the world? God is good, and no good\nperson is grudging of anything that is good. Therefore, God made it the best world possible.\" Hand\ndown your opinion, then, O judge; state who seems to you to say what is truest, and not who says\nwhat is absolutely true. For to do that is as far beyond our ken as truth itself.", "This throng of causes, defined by Aristotle and by Plato, embraces either too much or too little. For if\nthey regard as \"causes\" of an object that is to be made everything without which the object cannot\nbe made, they have named too few. Time must be included among the causes; for nothing can be\nmade without time. They must also include place; for if there be no place where a thing can be\nmade, it will not be made. And motion too; nothing is either made or destroyed without motion.\nThere is no art without motion, no change of any kind. Now, however, I am searching for the first,\nthe general cause; this must be simple, inasmuch as matter, too, is simple. Do we ask what cause\nis? It is surely Creative Reason, ? in other words, God. For those elements to which you referred are\nnot a great series of independent causes; they all hinge on one alone, and that will be the creative\ncause. Do you maintain that form is a cause? This is only what the artist stamps upon his work; it is\npart of a cause, but not the cause. Neither is the pattern a cause, but an indispensable tool of the\ncause. His pattern is as indispensable to the artist as the chisel or the file; without these, art can\nmake no progress. But for all that, these things are neither parts of the art, nor causes of it. \"Then,\"\nperhaps you will say, \"the purpose of the artist, that which leads him to undertake to create\nsomething, is the cause.\" It may be a cause; it is not, however, the efficient cause, but only an\naccessory cause. But there are countless accessory causes; what we are discussing is the general\ncause. Now the statement of Plato and Aristotle is not in accord with their usual penetration, when\nthey maintain that the whole universe, the perfectly wrought work, is a cause. For there is a great\ndifference between a work and the cause of a work.", "Either give your opinion, or, as is easier in cases of this kind, declare that the matter is not clear and\ncall for another hearing. But you will reply: \"What pleasure do you get from wasting your time on\nthese problems, which relieve you of none of your emotions, rout none of your desires?\" So far as I\nam concerned, I treat and discuss them as matters which contribute greatly toward calming the\nspirit, and I search myself first, and then the world about me. And not even now am I, as you think,\nwasting my time. For all these questions, provided that they be not chopped up and torn apart into\nsuch unprofitable refinements, elevate and lighten the soul, which is weighted down by a heavy\nburden and desires to be freed and to return to the elements of which it was once a part. For this\nbody of ours is a weight upon the soul and its penance; as the load presses down the soul is\ncrushed and is in bondage, unless philosophy has come to its assistance and has bid it take fresh\ncourage by contemplating the\nuniverse, and has turned it from things earthly to things divine. There it has its liberty, there it can\nroam abroad; meantime it escapes the custody in which it is bound, and renews its life in heaven.\nJust as skilled workmen, who have been engaged upon some delicate piece of work which wearies\ntheir eyes with straining, if the light which they have is niggardly or uncertain, go forth into the open\nair and in some park devoted to the people's recreation delight their eyes in the generous light of\nday; so the soul, imprisoned as it has been in this gloomy and darkened house, seeks the open sky\nwhenever it can, and in the contemplation of the universe finds rest.", "The wise man, the seeker after wisdom, is bound closely, indeed, to his body, but he is an absentee\nso far as his better self is concerned, and he concentrates his thoughts upon lofty things. Bound, so\nto speak, to his oath of allegiance, he regards the period of life as his term of service. He is so\ntrained that he neither loves nor hates life; he endures a mortal lot, although he knows that an\nampler lot is in store for him. Do you forbid me to contemplate the universe? Do you compel me to\nwithdraw from the whole and restrict me to a part? May I not ask what are the beginnings of all\nthings, who moulded the universe, who took the confused and conglomerate mass of sluggish\nmatter, and separated it into its parts? May I not inquire who is the Master-Builder of this universe,\nhow the mighty bulk was brought under the control of law and order, who gathered together the\nscattered atoms, who separated the disordered elements and assigned an outward form to\nelements that lay in one vast shapelessness? Or whence came all the expanse of light? And\nwhether is it fire, or something even brighter than fire? Am I not to ask these questions? Must I be\nignorant of the heights whence I have descended? Whether I am to see this world but once, or to be\nborn many times? What is my destination afterwards? What abode awaits my soul on its release\nfrom the laws of slavery among men? Do you forbid me to have a share in heaven? In other words,\ndo you bid me live with my head bowed down? No, I am above such an existence; I was born to a\ngreater destiny than to be a mere chattel of my body, and I regard this body as nothing but a chain\nwhich manacles my freedom. Therefore, I offer it as a sort of buffer to fortune, and shall allow no\nwound to penetrate through to my soul. For my body is the only part of me which can suffer injury. In\nthis dwelling, which is exposed to peril, my soul lives free. Never shall this flesh drive me to feel fear,\nor to assume any pretence that is unworthy of a good man. Never shall I lie in order to honour this\npetty body. When it seems proper, I shall sever my connexion with it. And at present, while we are\nbound together, our alliance shall nevertheless not be one of equality; the soul shall bring all\nquarrels before its own tribunal. To despise our bodies is sure freedom.", "To return to our subject; this freedom will be greatly helped by the contemplation of which we were\njust speaking. All things are made up of matter and of God; God controls matter, which\nencompasses him and follows him as its guide and leader. And that which creates, in other words,\nGod, is more powerful and precious than matter, which is acted upon by God. God's place in the\nuniverse corresponds to the soul's relation to man. World-matter corresponds to our mortal body;\ntherefore let the lower serve the higher. Let us be brave in the face of hazards. Let us not fear\nwrongs, or wounds, or bonds, or poverty. And what is death? It is either the end, or a process of\nchange. I have no fear of ceasing to exist; it is the same as not having begun. Nor do I shrink from\nchanging into another state, because I shall, under no conditions, be as cramped as I am now.\nFarewell.", "I have just seen my former school-mate Claranus for the first time in many years. You need not wait\nfor me to add that he is an old man; but I assure you that I found him hale in spirit and sturdy,\nalthough he is wrestling with a frail and feeble body. For Nature acted unfairly when she gave him a\npoor domicile for so rare a soul; or perhaps it was because she wished to prove to us that an\nabsolutely strong and happy mind can lie hidden under any exterior. Be that as it may, Claranus\novercomes all these hindrances, and by despising his own body has arrived at a stage where he\ncan despise other things also. The poet who sang", "is, in my opinion, mistaken. For virtue needs nothing to set it off; it is its own great glory, and it\nhallows the body in which it dwells. At any rate, I have begun to regard Claranus in a different light;\nhe seems to me handsome, and as well-set-up in body as in mind. A great man can spring from a\nhovel; so can a beautiful and great soul from an ugly and insignificant body. For this reason Nature\nseems to\nme to breed certain men of this stamp with the idea of proving that virtue springs into birth in any\nplace whatever. Had it been possible for her to produce souls by themselves and naked, she would\nhave done so; as it is, Nature does a still greater thing, for she produces certain men who, though\nhampered in their bodies, none the less break through the obstruction. I think Claranus has been\nproduced as a pattern, that we might be enabled to understand that the soul is not disfigured by the\nugliness of the body, but rather the opposite, that the body is beautified by the comeliness of the\nsoul.", "Now, though Claranus and I have spent very few days together, we have nevertheless had many\nconversations, which I will at once pour forth and pass on to you.\nThe first day we investigated this problem: how can goods be equal if they are of three kinds? For\ncertain of them, according to our philosophical tenets, are primary, such as joy, peace, and the\nwelfare of one's country. Others are of the second order, moulded in an unhappy material, such as\nthe endurance of suffering, and self-control during severe illness. We shall pray outright for the\ngoods of the first class; for the second class we shall pray only if the need shall arise. There is still a\nthird variety, as, for example, a modest gait, a calm and honest countenance, and a bearing that\nsuits the man of wisdom. Now how can these things be equal when we compare them, if you grant\nthat we ought to pray for the one and avoid the other? If we would make distinctions among them,\nwe had better return to the First Good, and consider what its nature is: the soul that gazes upon\ntruth, that is skilled in what should be sought and what should\nbe avoided, establishing standards of value not according to opinion, but according to nature, ? the\nsoul that penetrates the whole world and directs its contemplating gaze upon all its phenomena,\npaying strict attention to thoughts and actions, equally great and forceful, superior alike to hardships\nand blandishments, yielding itself to neither extreme of fortune, rising above all blessings and\ntribulations, absolutely beautiful, perfectly equipped with grace as well as with strength, healthy and\nsinewy, unruffled, undismayed, one which no violence can shatter, one which acts of chance can\nneither exalt nor depress, ? a soul like this is virtue itself. There you have its outward appearance, if\nit should ever come under a single view and show itself once in all its completeness. But there are\nmany aspects of it. They unfold themselves according as life varies and as actions differ; but virtue\nitself does not become less or greater. For the Supreme Good cannot diminish, nor may virtue\nretrograde; rather is it transformed, now into one quality and now into another, shaping itself\naccording to the part which it is to play. Whatever it has touched it brings into likeness with itself,\nand dyes with its own colour. It adorns our actions, our friendships, and sometimes entire\nhouseholds which it has entered and set in order. Whatever it has handled it forthwith makes", "From Alexander the grammarian, to refrain from fault-finding, and not in a reproachful way to chide\nthose who uttered any barbarous or solecistic or strange-sounding expression; but dexterously to\nintroduce the very expression which ought to have been used, and in the way of answer or giving\nconfirmation, or joining in an inquiry about the thing itself, not about the word, or by some other fit\nsuggestion.", "Thou wilt soon die, and thou art not yet simple, not free from perturbations, nor without suspicion of\nbeing hurt by external things, nor kindly disposed towards all; nor dost thou yet place wisdom only in\nacting justly.", "Therefore the power and the greatness of virtue cannot rise to greater heights, because increase is\ndenied to that which is superlatively great. You will find nothing straighter than the straight, nothing\ntruer than the truth, and nothing more temperate than that which is temperate. Every virtue is\nlimitless; for limits depend upon definite measurements. Constancy cannot advance further, any\nmore than fidelity, or truthfulness, or loyalty. What can be added to that which is perfect? Nothing\notherwise that was not perfect to which something has been added. Nor can anything be added to\nvirtue, either, for if anything can be added thereto, it must have contained a defect. Honour, also,\npermits of no addition; for it is honourable because of the very qualities which I have mentioned.\nWhat then? Do you think that propriety, justice, lawfulness, do not also belong to the same type, and\nthat they are kept within fixed limits? The ability to increase is proof that a thing is still imperfect.", "The good, in every instance, is subject to these same laws. The advantage of the state and that of\nthe individual are yoked together; indeed it is as impossible to separate them as to separate the\ncommendable from the desirable. Therefore, virtues are mutually equal; and so are the works of\nvirtue, and all men who are so fortunate as to possess these virtues. But, since the virtues of plants\nand of animals are perishable, they are also frail and fleeting and uncertain. They spring up, and\nthey sink down again, and for this reason they are not rated at the same value; but to human virtues\nonly one rule applies. For right reason is single and of but one kind. Nothing is more divine than the\ndivine, or more heavenly than the heavenly. Mortal things decay, fall, are worn out, grow up, are\nexhausted, and replenished. Hence, in their case, in view of the uncertainty of their lot, there is\ninequality; but of things divine the nature is one. Reason, however, is nothing else than a portion of\nthe divine spirit set in a human body. If reason is divine, and the good in no case lacks reason, then\nthe good in every case is divine. And furthermore, there is no distinction between things divine;\nhence there is none between goods, either. Therefore it follows that joy and a brave unyielding\nendurance of torture are equal goods; for in both there is the same greatness of soul relaxed and\ncheerful in the one case, in the other combative and braced for action. What? Do you not think that\nthe virtue of him who bravely storms the enemy's stronghold is equal to that of him who endures a\nsiege with the utmost patience? Great is Scipio when he invests Numantia, and constrains and\ncompels the hands of an enemy, whom he could not conquer, to resort to their own destruction.\nGreat also are the souls of the defenders ? men who know that, as long as the path to death lies\nopen, the blockade is not complete, men who breathe their last in the arms of liberty. In like manner,\nthe other virtues are also equal as compared with one another: tranquillity, simplicity, generosity,\nconstancy, equanimity, endurance. For underlying them all is a single virtue ? that which renders the\nsoul straight and unswerving.", "\"What then,\" you say; \"is there no difference between joy and unyielding endurance of pain?\" None\nat all, as regards the virtues themselves; very great, however, in the circumstances in which either of\nthese two virtues is displayed. In the one case, there is a natural relaxation and loosening of the\nsoul; in the other there is an unnatural pain. Hence these circumstances, between which a great\ndistinction can be drawn, belong to the category of indifferent things, but the virtue shown in each\ncase is equal. Virtue is not changed by the matter with which it deals; if the matter is hard and\nstubborn, it does not make the virtue worse; if pleasant and joyous, it does not make it better.\nTherefore, virtue necessarily remains equal. For, in each case, what is done is done with equal\nuprightness, with equal wisdom, and with equal honour. Hence the states of goodness involved are\nequal, and it is impossible for a man to transcend these states of goodness by conducting himself\nbetter, either the one man in his joy, or the other amid his suffering. And two goods, neither of which\ncan possibly be better, are equal. For if things which are extrinsic to virtue can either diminish or\nincrease virtue, then that which is honourable ceases to be the only good. If you grant this, honour\nhas wholly perished. And why? Let me tell you: it is because no act is honourable that is done by an\nunwilling agent, that is compulsory. Every honourable act is voluntary. Alloy it with reluctance,\ncomplaints, cowardice, or fear, and it loses its best characteristic ? self-approval. That which is not\nfree cannot be honourable; for fear means slavery. The honourable is wholly free from anxiety and is\ncalm; if it ever objects, laments, or regards anything as an evil, it becomes subject to disturbance\nand begins to flounder about amid great confusion. For on one side the semblance of right calls to it,\non the other the suspicion of evil drags it back. Therefore, when a man is about to do something\nhonourable, he should not regard any obstacles as evils, even though he regard them as\ninconvenient, but he should will to do the deed, and do it willingly. For every honourable act is done\nwithout commands or compulsion; it is unalloyed and contains no admixture of evil.", "I know what you may reply to me at this point: \"Are you trying to make us believe that it does not\nmatter whether a man feels joy, or whether he lies upon the rack and tires out his torturer?\" I might\nsay in answer: \"Epicurus also maintains that the wise man, though he is being burned in the bull of\nPhalaris, will cry out: 'Tis pleasant, and concerns me not at all.'\" Why need you wonder, if I maintain\nthat he who reclines at a banquet and the victim who stoutly withstands torture possess equal\ngoods, when Epicurus maintains a thing that is harder to believe, namely, that it is pleasant to be\nroasted in this way? But the reply which I do make, is that there is great difference between joy and\npain; if I am asked to choose, I shall seek the former and avoid the latter. The former is according to\nnature, the latter contrary to it. So long as they are rated by this standard, there is a great gulf\nbetween; but when it comes to a question of the virtue involved, the virtue in each case is the same,\nwhether it comes through joy or through sorrow. Vexation and pain and other inconveniences are of\nno consequence, for they are overcome by virtue. Just as the brightness of the sun dims all lesser\nlights, so virtue, by its own greatness, shatters and overwhelms all pains, annoyances, and wrongs;\nand wherever its radiance reaches, all lights which shine without the help of virtue are extinguished;\nand inconveniences, when they come in contact with virtue, play no more important a part than does\na storm-cloud at sea.", "This can be proved to you by the fact that the good man will hasten unhesitatingly to any noble\ndeed; even though he be confronted by the hangman, the torturer, and the stake, he will persist,\nregarding not what he must suffer, but what he must do; and he will entrust himself as readily to an\nhonourable deed as he would to a good man; he will consider it advantageous to himself, safe,\npropitious. And he will hold the same view concerning an honourable deed, even though it be\nfraught with sorrow and hardship, as concerning a good man who is poor or wasting away in exile.\nCome now, contrast a good man who is rolling in wealth with a man who has nothing, except that in\nhimself he has all things; they will be equally good, though they experience unequal fortune. This\nsame standard, as I have remarked, is to be applied to things as well as to men; virtue is just as\npraiseworthy if it dwells in a sound and free body, as in one which is sickly or in bondage. Therefore,\nas regards your own virtue also, you will not praise it any more, if fortune has favoured it by granting\nyou a sound body, than if fortune has endowed you with a body that is crippled in some member,\nsince that would mean rating a master low because he is dressed like a slave. For all those things\nover which Chance holds sway are chattels, ? money, person, position; they are weak, shifting,\nprone to perish, and of uncertain tenure. On the other hand, the works of virtue are free and\nunsubdued, neither more worthy to be sought when fortune treats them kindly, nor less worthy when\nany adversity weighs upon them.", "Now friendship in the case of men corresponds to desirability in the case of things. You would not, I\nfancy, love a good man if he were rich any more than if he were poor, nor would you love a strong\nand muscular person more than one who was slender and of delicate constitution. Accordingly,\nneither will you seek or love a good thing that is mirthful and tranquil more than one that is full of\nperplexity and toil. Or, if you do this, you will, in the case of two equally good men, care more for him\nwho is neat and well-groomed than for him who is dirty and unkempt. You would next go so far as to\ncare more for a good man who is sound in all his limbs and without blemish, than for one who is\nweak or purblind; and gradually your fastidiousness would reach such a point that, of two equally\njust and prudent men, you would choose him who has long curling hair! Whenever the virtue in each\none is equal, the inequality in their other attributes is not apparent. For all other things are not parts,\nbut merely accessories. Would any man judge his children so unfairly as to care more for a healthy\nson than for one who was sickly, or for a tall child of unusual stature more than for one who was\nshort or of middling height? Wild beasts show no favouritism among their offspring; they lie down in\norder to suckle all alike; birds make fair distribution of their food. Ulysses hastens back to the rocks\nof his Ithaca as eagerly as Agamemnon speeds to the kingly walls of Mycenae. For no man loves\nhis native land because it is great; he loves it because it is his own.", "And what is the purpose of all this? That you may know that virtue regards all her works in the same\nlight, as if they were her children, showing equal kindness to all, and still deeper kindness to those\nwhich encounter hardships; for even parents lean with more affection towards those of their\noffspring for whom they feel pity. Virtue, too, does not necessarily love more deeply those of her\nworks which she beholds in trouble and under heavy burdens, but, like good parents, she gives\nthem more of her fostering care.", "Why is no good greater than any other good? It is because nothing can be more fitting than that\nwhich is fitting, and nothing more level than that which is level. You cannot say that one thing is\nmore equal to a given object than another thing; hence also nothing is more honourable than that\nwhich is honourable. Accordingly, if all the virtues are by nature equal, the three varieties of goods\nare equal. This is what I mean: there is an equality between feeling joy with self-control and suffering\npain with self-control. The joy in the one case does not surpass in the other the steadfastness of\nsoul that gulps down the groan when the victim is in the clutches of the torturer; goods of the first\nkind are desirable, while those of the second are worthy of admiration; and in each case they are\nnone the less equal, because whatever inconvenience attaches to the latter is compensated by the\nqualities of the good, which is so much greater. Any man who believes them to be unequal is turning\nhis gaze away from the virtues themselves and is surveying mere externals; true goods have the\nsame weight and the same width. The spurious sort contain much emptiness; hence, when they are\nweighed in the balance, they are found wanting, although they look imposing and grand to the gaze.", "Yes, my dear Lucilius, the good which true reason approves is solid and everlasting; it strengthens\nthe spirit and exalts it, so that it will always be on the heights; but those things which are\nthoughtlessly praised, and are goods in the opinion of the mob merely puff us up with empty joy.\nAnd again, those things which are feared as if they were evils merely inspire trepidation in men's\nminds, for the mind is disturbed by the semblance of danger, just as animals are disturbed. Hence it\nis without\nreason that both these things distract and sting the spirit; the one is not worthy of joy, nor the other\nof fear. It is reason alone that is unchangeable, that holds fast to its decisions. For reason is not a\nslave to the senses, but a ruler over them. Reason is equal to reason, as one straight line to\nanother; therefore virtue also is equal to virtue. Virtue is nothing else than right reason. All virtues\nare reasons. Reasons are reasons, if they are right reasons. If they are right, they are also equal. As\nreason is, so also are actions; therefore all actions are equal. For since they resemble reason, they\nalso resemble each other. Moreover, I hold that actions are equal to each other in so far as they are\nhonourable and right actions. There will be, of course, great differences according as the material\nvaries, as it becomes now broader and now narrower, now glorious and now base, now manifold in\nscope and now limited. However, that which is best in all these cases is equal; they are all\nhonourable. In the same way, all good men, in so far as they are good, are equal. There are,\nindeed, differences of age, ? one is older, another younger; of body, ? one is comely, another is\nugly; of fortune, ? this man is rich, that man poor, this one is influential, powerful, and well-known to\ncities and peoples, that man is unknown to most, and is obscure. But all, in respect of that wherein\nthey are good, are equal. The senses do not decide upon things good and evil; they do not know\nwhat is useful and what is not useful. They cannot record their opinion unless they are brought face\nto face with a fact; they can neither see into the future nor recollect the past; and they do not know\nwhat results from what. But it is from such knowledge that a sequence and succession of actions is\nwoven, and a unity of life is created, ? a unity which will proceed in a straight course. Reason,\ntherefore, is the judge of good and evil; that which is foreign and external she regards as dross, and", "that which is neither good nor evil she judges as merely accessory, insignificant and trivial. For all\nher good resides in the soul.", "But there are certain goods which reason regards as primary, to which she addresses herself\npurposely; these are, for example, victory, good children, and the welfare of one's country. Certain\nothers she regards as secondary; these become manifest only in adversity, ? for example,\nequanimity in enduring severe illness or exile. Certain goods are indifferent; these are no more\naccording to nature than contrary to nature, as, for example, a discreet gait and a sedate posture in\na chair. For sitting is an act that is not less according to nature than standing or walking. The two\nkinds of goods which are of a higher order are different; the primary are according to nature, ? such\nas deriving joy from the dutiful behaviour of one's children and from the well-being of one's country.\nThe secondary are contrary to nature, ? such as fortitude in resisting torture or in enduring thirst\nwhen illness makes the vitals feverish. \"What then,\" you say; \"can anything that is contrary to nature\nbe a good?\" Of course not; but that in which this good takes its rise is sometimes contrary to nature.\nFor being wounded, wasting away over a fire, being afflicted with bad health, ? such things are\ncontrary to nature; but it is in accordance with nature for a man to preserve an indomitable soul amid\nsuch distresses. To explain my thought briefly, the material with which a good is concerned is\nsometimes contrary to nature, but a good itself never is contrary, since no good is without reason,\nand reason is in accordance with nature.", "Examine men's ruling principles, even those of the wise, what kind of things they avoid, and what\nkind they pursue.", "\"What, then,\" you ask, \"is reason?\" It is copying nature. \"And what,\" you say, \"is the greatest good\nthat man can possess?\" It is to conduct oneself according to what nature wills. \"There is no doubt,\"\nsays the objector, \"that peace affords more happiness when it has not been assailed than when it\nhas been recovered at the cost of great slaughter.\" \"There is no doubt also,\" he continues, \"that\nhealth which has not been impaired affords more happiness than health which has been restored to\nsoundness by means of force, as it were, and by endurance of suffering, after serious illnesses that\nthreaten life itself. And similarly there will be no doubt that joy is a greater good than a soul's\nstruggle to endure to the bitter end the torments of wounds or burning at the stake.\" By no means.\nFor things that result from hazard admit of wide distinctions, since they are rated according to their\nusefulness in the eyes of those who experience them, but with regard to goods, the only point to be\nconsidered is that they are in agreement with nature; and this is equal in the case of all goods.\nWhen at a meeting of the Senate we vote in favour of someone's motion, it cannot be said, \"A. is\nmore in accord with the motion than B.\" All alike vote for the same motion. I make the same\nstatement with regard to virtues, ? they are all in accord with nature; and I make it with regard to\ngoods also, ? they are all in accord with nature. One man dies young, another in old age, and still\nanother in infancy, having enjoyed nothing more than a mere glimpse out into life. They have all\nbeen equally subject to death, even though death has permitted the one to proceed farther along the\npathway of life, has cut off the life of the second in his flower, and has broken off the life of the third\nat its very beginning. Some get their release at the dinner-table. Others extend their sleep into the\nsleep of death. Some are blotted out during dissipation. Now contrast with these persons individuals\nwho have been pierced by the sword, or bitten to death by snakes, or crushed in ruins, or tortured\npiecemeal out of existence by the prolonged twisting of their sinews. Some of these departures may\nbe regarded as better, some as worse; but the act of dying is equal in all. The methods of ending life\nare different; but the end is one and the same. Death has no degrees of greater or less; for it has\nthe same limit in all instances, ? the finishing of life.", "The same thing holds true, I assure you, concerning goods; you will find one amid circumstances of\npure pleasure, another amid sorrow and bitterness. The one controls the favours of fortune; the\nother overcomes her onslaughts. Each is equally a good, although the one travels a level and easy\nroad, and the other a rough road. And the end of them all is the same: they are goods, they are\nworthy of praise, they accompany virtue and reason. Virtue makes all the things that it\nacknowledges equal to one another. You need not wonder that this is one of our principles; we find\nmentioned in the works of Epicurus two goods, of which his Supreme Good, or blessedness, is\ncomposed, namely, a body free from pain and a soul free from disturbance. These goods, if they are\ncomplete, do not increase; for how can that which is complete increase? The body is, let us\nsuppose, free from pain; what increase can there be to this absence of pain? The soul is composed\nand calm; what increase can there be to this tranquillity? Just as fair weather, purified into the purest\nbrilliancy, does not admit of a still greater degree of clearness; so, when a man takes care of his\nbody and of his soul, weaving the texture of his good from both, his condition is perfect, and he has\nfound the consummation of his prayers, if there is no commotion in his soul or pain in his body.\nWhatever delights fall to his lot over and above these two things do not increase his Supreme Good;\nthey merely season it, so to speak, and add spice to it. For the absolute good of man's nature is\nsatisfied with peace in the body and peace in the soul.\nI can show you at this moment in the writings of Epicurus a graded list of goods just like that of our\nown school. For there are some things, he declares, which he prefers should fall to his lot, such as\nbodily rest free from all inconvenience, and relaxation of the soul as it takes delight in the\ncontemplation of its own goods. And there are other things which, though he would prefer that they\ndid not happen, he nevertheless praises and approves, ? for example, the kind of resignation, in\ntimes of ill-health and serious suffering, to which I alluded a moment ago, and which Epicurus\ndisplayed on that last and most blessed day of his life. For he tells us that he had to endure\nexcruciating agony from a diseased bladder and from an ulcerated stomach, ? so acute that it\npermitted no increase of pain; \"and yet,\" he says, \"that day was none the less happy.\" And no man", "can spend such a day in happiness unless he possesses the Supreme Good.", "We therefore find mentioned, even by Epicurus, those goods which one would prefer not to\nexperience; which, however, because circumstances have decided thus, must be welcomed and\napproved and placed on a level with the highest goods. We cannot say that the good which has\nrounded out a happy life, the good for which Epicurus rendered thanks in the last words he uttered,\nis not equal to the greatest. Allow me, excellent Lucilius, to utter a still bolder word: if any goods\ncould be greater than others, I should prefer those which seem harsh to those which are mild and\nalluring, and should pronounce them greater. For it is more of an accomplishment to break one's\nway through difficulties than to keep joy within bounds. It requires the same use of reason, I am fully\naware, for a man to endure prosperity well and also to endure misfortune bravely. That man may be\njust as brave who sleeps in front of the ramparts without fear of danger when no enemy attacks the\ncamp, as the man who, when the tendons of his legs have been severed, holds himself up on his\nknees and does not let fall his weapons; but it is to the blood-stained soldier returning from the front\nthat men cry: \"Well done, thou hero!\" And therefore I should bestow greater praise upon those\ngoods that have stood trial, and show courage, and have fought it out with fortune. Should I hesitate\nwhether to give greater praise to the maimed and shrivelled hand of Mucius than to the uninjured\nhand of the bravest man in the world? There stood Mucius, despising the enemy and despising the\nfire, and watched his hand as it dripped blood over the fire on his enemy's altar, until Porsenna,\nenvying the fame of the hero whose punishment he was advocating, ordered the fire to be removed\nagainst the will of the victim.", "Why should I not reckon this good among the primary goods, and deem it in so far greater than\nthose other goods which are unattended by danger and have made no trial of fortune, as it is a rarer\nthing to have overcome a foe with a hand lost than with a hand armed? \"What then?\" you say; \"shall\nyou desire this good for yourself?\" Of course I shall. For this is a thing that a man cannot achieve\nunless he can also desire it. Should I desire, instead, to be allowed to stretch out my limbs for my\nslaves to massage, or to have a woman, or a man changed into the likeness of a woman, pull my\nfinger-joints? I cannot help believing that Mucius was all the more lucky because he manipulated the\nflames as calmly as if he were holding out his hand to the manipulator. He had wiped out all his\nprevious mistakes; he finished the war unarmed and maimed; and with that stump of a hand he\nconquered two kings. Farewell.", "If I may begin with a commonplace remark, spring is gradually disclosing itself; but though it is\nrounding into summer, when you would expect hot weather, it has kept rather cool, and one cannot\nyet be sure of it. For it often slides back into winter weather. Do you wish to know how uncertain it\nstill is? I do not yet trust myself to a bath which is absolutely cold; even at this time I break its chill.\nYou may say that this is no way to show the endurance either of heat or of cold; very true, dear\nLucilius, but at my time of life one is at length contented with the natural chill of the body. I can\nscarcely thaw out in the middle of summer. Accordingly, I spend most of the time bundled up; and I\nthank old age for keeping me fastened to my bed. Why should I not thank old age on this account?\nThat which I ought not to wish to do, I lack the ability to do. Most of my converse is with books.\nWhenever your letters arrive, I imagine that I am with you, and I have the feeling that I am about to\nspeak my answer, instead of writing it. Therefore let us together investigate the nature of this\nproblem of yours, just as if we were conversing with one another.", "You ask me whether every good is desirable. You say: \"If it is a good to be brave under torture, to\ngo to the stake with a stout heart, to endure illness with resignation, it follows that these things are\ndesirable. But I do not see that any of them is worth praying for. At any rate I have as yet known of\nno man who has paid a vow by reason of having been cut to pieces by the rod, or twisted out of\nshape by the gout, or made taller by the rack.\" My dear Lucilius, you must distinguish between these\ncases; you will then comprehend that there is something in them that is to be desired. I should\nprefer to be free from torture; but if the time comes when it must be endured, I shall desire that I may\nconduct myself therein with bravery, honour, and courage. Of course I prefer that war should not\noccur; but if war does occur, I shall desire that I may nobly endure the wounds, the starvation, and\nall that the exigency of war brings. Nor am I so mad as to crave illness; but if I must suffer illness, I\nshall desire that I may do nothing which shows lack of restraint, and nothing that is unmanly. The\nconclusion is, not that hardships are desirable, but that virtue is desirable, which enables us\npatiently to endure hardships.", "Certain of our school, think that, of all such qualities, a stout endurance is not desirable, ? though\nnot to be deprecated either ? because we ought to seek by prayer only the good which is unalloyed,\npeaceful, and beyond the reach of trouble. Personally, I do not agree with them. And why? First,\nbecause it is impossible for anything to be good without being also desirable. Because, again, if\nvirtue is desirable, and if nothing that is good lacks virtue, then everything good is desirable. And,\nlastly, because a brave endurance even under torture is desirable. At this point I ask you: Is not\nbravery desirable? And yet bravery despises and challenges danger. The most beautiful and most\nadmirable part of bravery is that it does not shrink from the stake, advances to meet wounds, and\nsometimes does not even avoid the spear, but meets it with opposing breast. If bravery is desirable,\nso is patient endurance of torture; for this is a part of bravery. Only sift these things, as I have\nsuggested; then there will be nothing which can lead you astray. For it is not mere endurance of\ntorture, but brave endurance, that is desirable. I therefore desire that \"brave\" endurance; and this is\nvirtue.", "\"But,\" you say, \"who ever desired such a thing for himself?\" Some prayers are open and outspoken,\nwhen the requests are offered specifically; other prayers are indirectly expressed, when they include\nmany requests under one title. For example, I desire a life of honour. Now a life of honour includes\nvarious kinds of conduct; it may include the chest in which Regulus was confined, or the wound of\nCato which was torn open by Cato's own hand, or the exile of Rutilius, or the cup of poison which\nremoved Socrates from gaol to heaven. Accordingly, in praying for a life of honour, I have prayed\nalso for those things without which, on some occasions, life cannot be honourable", "Who underneath the lofty walls of Troy\nMet happy death before their parents' eyes!", "What does it matter whether you offer this prayer for some individual, or admit that it was desirable\nin the past? Decius sacrificed himself for the State; he set spurs to his horse and rushed into the\nmidst of the foe, seeking death. The second Decius, rivalling his father's valour, reproducing the\nwords which had become sacred and already household words, dashed into the thickest of the fight,\nanxious only that his sacrifice might bring omen of success, and regarding a noble death as a thing\nto be desired. Do you doubt, then, whether it is best to die glorious and performing some deed of\nvalour? When one endures torture bravely, one is using all the virtues. Endurance may perhaps be\nthe only virtue that is on view and most manifest; but bravery is there too, and endurance and\nresignation and long-suffering are its branches. There, too, is foresight; for without foresight no plan\ncan be undertaken; it is foresight that advises one to bear as bravely as possible the things one\ncannot avoid. There also is steadfastness, which cannot be dislodged from its position, which the\nwrench of no force can cause to abandon its purpose. There is the whole inseparable company of\nvirtues; every honourable act is the work of one single virtue, but it is in accordance with the\njudgment of the whole council. And that which is approved by all the virtues, even though it seems\nto be the work of one alone, is desirable.", "What is evil to thee does not subsist in the ruling principle of another; nor yet in any turning and\nmutation of thy corporeal covering. Where is it then? It is in that part of thee in which subsists the\npower of forming opinions about evils. Let this power then not form such opinions, and all is well.\nAnd if that which is nearest to it, the poor body, is burnt, filled with matter and rottenness,\nnevertheless let the part which forms opinions about these things be quiet, that is, let it judge that\nnothing is either bad or good which can happen equally to the bad man and the good. For that which\nhappens equally to him who lives contrary to nature and to him who lives according to nature, is\nneither according to nature nor contrary to nature.", "What? Do you think that those things only are\ndesirable which come to us amid pleasure and ease, and which we bedeck our doors to welcome?\nThere are certain goods whose features are forbidding. There are certain prayers which are offered\nby a throng, not of men who rejoice, but of men who bow down reverently and worship. Was it not in\nthis fashion, think you, that Regulus prayed that he might reach Carthage? Clothe yourself with a\nhero's courage, and withdraw for a little space from the opinions of the common man. Form a proper\nconception of the image of virtue, a thing of exceeding beauty and grandeur; this image is not to be\nworshipped by us with incense or garlands, but with sweat and blood. Behold Marcus Cato, laying\nupon that hallowed breast his unspotted hands, and tearing apart the wounds which had not gone\ndeep enough to kill him! Which, pray, shall you say to him: \"I hope all will be as you wish,\" and \"I am\ngrieved,\" or shall it be \"Good fortune in your undertaking!\"?", "In this connexion I think of our friend Demetrius, who calls an easy existence, untroubled by the\nattacks of Fortune, a \"Dead Sea.\" If you have nothing to stir you up and rouse you to action, nothing\nwhich will test your resolution by its threats and hostilities; if you recline in unshaken comfort, it is not\ntranquillity; it is merely a flat calm. The Stoic Attalus was wont to say: \"I should prefer that Fortune\nkeep me in her camp rather than in the lap of luxury. If I am tortured, but bear it bravely, all is well; if\nI die, but die bravely, it is also well.\" Listen to Epicurus; he will tell you that it is actually pleasant. I\nmyself shall never apply an effeminate word to an act so honourable and austere. If I go to the\nstake, I shall go unbeaten. Why should I not regard this as desirable ? not because the fire, burns\nme, but because it does not overcome me? Nothing is more excellent or more beautiful than virtue;\nwhatever we do in obedience to her orders is both good and desirable. Farewell.", "I fall in with your plan; retire and conceal yourself in repose. But at the same time conceal your\nretirement also. In doing this, you may be sure that you will be following the example of the Stoics, if\nnot their precept. But you will be acting according to their precept also; you will thus satisfy both\nyourself and any Stoic you please. We Stoics do not urge men to take up public life in every case, or\nat all times, or without any qualification. Besides, when we have assigned to our wise man that field\nof public life which is worthy of him, ? in other words, the universe, ? he is then not apart from public\nlife, even if he withdraws; nay, perhaps he has abandoned only one little corner thereof and has\npassed over into greater and wider regions; and when he has been set in the heavens, he\nunderstands how lowly was the place in which he sat when he mounted the curule chair or the\njudgment-seat. Lay this to heart, ? that the wise man is never more active in affairs than when things\ndivine as well as things human have come within his ken.", "I now return to the advice which I set out to give\nyou, ? that you keep your retirement in the background. There is no need to fasten a placard upon\nyourself with the words: \"Philosopher and Quietist.\" Give your purpose some other name; call it\nill-health and bodily weakness, or mere laziness. To boast of our retirement is but idle self-seeking.\nCertain animals hide themselves from discovery by confusing the marks of their foot-prints in the\nneighbourhood of their lairs. You should do the same. Otherwise, there will always be someone\ndogging your footsteps. Many men pass by that which is visible, and peer after things hidden and\nconcealed; a locked room invites the thief. Things which lie in the open appear cheap; the\nhouse-breaker passes by that which is exposed to view. This is the way of the world, and the way of\nall ignorant men: they crave to burst in upon hidden things. It is therefore best not to vaunt one's\nretirement. It is, however, a sort of vaunting to make too much of one's concealment and of one's\nwithdrawal from the sight of men. So-and-so has gone into his retreat at Tarentum; that other man\nhas shut himself up at Naples; this third person for many years has not crossed the threshold of his\nown house. To advertise one's retirement is to collect a crowd. When you withdraw from the world\nyour business is to talk with yourself, not to have men talk about you. But what shall you talk about?\nDo just what people are fond of doing when they talk about their neighbours, ? speak ill of yourself\nwhen by yourself; then you will become accustomed both to speak and to hear the truth. Above all,\nhowever, ponder that which you come to feel is your greatest weakness. Each man knows best the\ndefects of his own body. And so one relieves his stomach by vomiting, another props it up by\nfrequent eating, another drains and purges his body by periodic fasting. Those whose feet are\nvisited by pain abstain either from wine or from the bath. In general, men who are careless in other\nrespects go out of their way to relieve the disease which frequently afflicts them. So it is with our\nsouls; there are in them certain parts which are, so to speak, on the sick-list, and to these parts the\ncure must be applied.", "What, then, am I myself doing with my leisure? I am trying to cure my own sores. If I were to show\nyou a swollen foot, or an inflamed hand, or some shrivelled sinews in a withered leg, you would\npermit me to lie quiet in one place and to apply lotions to the diseased member. But my trouble is\ngreater than any of these, and I cannot show it to you. The abscess, or ulcer, is deep within my\nbreast. Pray, pray, do not commend me, do not say: \"What a great man! He has learned to despise\nall things; condemning the madnesses of man's life, he has made his escape!\" I have condemned\nnothing except myself. There is no reason why you should desire to come to me for the sake of\nmaking progress. You are mistaken if you think that you will get any assistance from this quarter; it\nis not a physician that dwells here, but a sick man. I would rather have you say, on leaving my\npresence: \"I used to think him a happy man and a learned one, and I had pricked up my ears to hear\nhim; but I have been defrauded. I have seen nothing, heard nothing which I craved and which I\ncame back to hear.\" If you feel thus, and speak thus, some progress has been made. I prefer you to\npardon rather than envy my retirement.", "Then you say: \"Is it retirement, Seneca, that you are recommending to me? You will soon be falling\nback upon the maxims of Epicurus!\" I do recommend retirement to you, but only that you may use it\nfor greater and more beautiful activities than those which you have resigned; to knock at the\nhaughty doors of the influential, to make alphabetical lists of childless old men, to wield the highest\nauthority in public life, ? this kind of power exposes you to hatred, is short-lived, and, if you rate it at\nits true value, is tawdry. One man shall be far ahead of me as regards his influence in public life,\nanother in salary as an army officer and in the position which results from this, another in the throng\nof his clients; but it is worth while to be outdone by all these men, provided that I myself can outdo\nFortune. And I am no match for her in the throng; she has the greater backing.", "Would that in earlier days you had been minded to follow this purpose! Would that we were not\ndiscussing the happy life in plain view of death! But even now let us have no delay. For now we can\ntake the word of experience, which tells us that there are many superfluous and hostile things; for\nthis we should long since have taken the word of reason. Let us do what men are wont to do when\nthey are late in setting forth, and wish to make up for lost time by increasing their speed ? let us ply\nthe spur. Our time of life is the best possible for these pursuits; for the period of boiling and foaming\nis now past. The faults that were uncontrolled in the first fierce heat of youth are now weakened, and\nbut little further effort is needed to extinguish them.", "\"And when,\" you ask, \"will that profit you which you do not learn until your departure, and how will it\nprofit you?\" Precisely in this way, that I shall depart a better man. You need not think, however, that\nany time of life is more fitted to the attainment of a sound mind than that which has gained the\nvictory over itself by many trials and by long and oft-repeated regret for past mistakes, and, its\npassions assuaged, has reached a state of health. This is indeed the time to have acquired this\ngood; he who has attained wisdom in his old age, has attained it by his years. Farewell.", "Occurri, rides . . .\n. . . quid, mea cum pugnat sententia secum?", "Constantly regard the universe as one living being, having one substance and one soul; and\nobserve how all things have reference to one perception, the perception of this one living being; and\nhow all things act with one movement; and how all things are the cooperating causes of all things\nwhich exist; observe too the continuous spinning of the thread and the contexture of the web.", "I do not like you to change your headquarters and scurry about from one place to another. My\nreasons are, ? first, that such frequent flitting means an unsteady spirit. And the spirit cannot\nthrough retirement grow into unity unless it has ceased from its inquisitiveness and its wanderings.\nTo be able to hold your spirit in check, you must first stop the runaway flight of the body. My second\nreason is, that the remedies which are most helpful are those which are not interrupted. You should\nnot allow your quiet, or the oblivion to which you have consigned your former life, to be broken into.\nGive your eyes time to unlearn what they have seen, and your ears to grow accustomed to more\nwholesome words. Whenever you stir abroad you will meet, even as you pass from one place to\nanother, things that will bring back your old cravings. Just as he who tries to be rid of an old love\nmust avoid every reminder of the person once held dear (for nothing grows again so easily as love),\nsimilarly, he who would lay aside his desire for all the things which he used to crave so passionately,\nmust turn away both eyes and ears from the objects which he has abandoned. The emotions soon\nreturn to the attack; at every turn they will notice before their eyes an object worth their attention.\nThere is no evil that does not offer inducements. Avarice promises money; luxury, a varied\nassortment of pleasures; ambition, a purple robe and applause, and the influence which results from\napplause, and all that influence can do. Vices tempt you by the rewards which they offer; but in the\nlife of which I speak, you must live without being paid. Scarcely will a whole life-time suffice to bring\nour vices into subjection and to make them accept the yoke, swollen as they are by long-continued\nindulgence; and still less, if we cut into our brief span by any interruptions. Even constant care and\nattention can scarcely bring any one undertaking to full completion. If you will give ear to my advice,\nponder and practise this, ? how to welcome death, or even, if circumstances commend that course,\nto invite it. There is no difference whether death comes to us, or whether we go to death. Make\nyourself believe that all ignorant men are wrong when they say: \"It is a beautiful thing to die one's\nown death.\" But there is no man who does not die his own death. What is more, you may reflect on\nthis thought: No one dies except on his own day. You are throwing away none of your own time; for\nwhat you leave behind does not belong to you. Farewell.", "After a long space of time I have seen your beloved Pompeii. I was thus brought again face to face\nwith the days of my youth. And it seemed to me that I could still do, nay, had only done a short time\nago, all the things which I did there when a young man. We have sailed past life, Lucilius, as if we\nwere on a voyage, and just as when at sea, to quote from our poet Vergil,", "even so, on this journey where time flies with the greatest speed, we put below the horizon first our\nboyhood and then our youth, and then the space which lies between young manhood and middle\nage and borders on both, and next, the best years of old age itself. Last of all, we begin to sight the\ngeneral bourne of the race of man. Fools that we are, we believe this bourne to be a dangerous\nreef; but it is the harbour, where we must some day put in, which we may never refuse to enter; and\nif a man has reached this harbour in his early years, he has no more right to complain than a sailor\nwho has made a quick voyage. For some sailors, as you know, are tricked and held back by\nsluggish winds, and grow weary and sick of the slow-moving calm; while others are carried quickly\nhome by steady gales.", "You may consider that the same thing happens to us: life has carried some men with the greatest\nrapidity to the harbour, the harbour they were bound to reach even if they tarried on the way, while\nothers it has fretted and harassed. To such a life, as you are aware, one should not always cling.\nFor mere living is not a good, but living well. Accordingly, the wise man will live as long as he ought,\nnot as long as he can. He will mark in what place, with whom, and how he is to conduct his\nexistence, and what he is about to do. He always reflects concerning the quality, and not the\nquantity, of his life. As soon as there are many events in his life that give him trouble and disturb his\npeace of mind, he sets himself free. And this privilege is his, not only when the crisis is upon him,\nbut as soon as Fortune seems to be playing him false; then he looks about carefully and sees\nwhether he ought, or ought not, to end his life on that account. He holds that it makes no difference\nto him whether his taking-off be natural or self-inflicted, whether it comes later or earlier. He does\nnot regard it with fear, as if it were a great loss; for no man can lose very much when but a driblet\nremains. It is not a question of dying earlier or later, but of dying well or ill. And dying well means\nescape from the danger of living ill.", "That is why I regard the words of the well-known Rhodian as most unmanly. This person was thrown\ninto a cage by his tyrant, and fed there like some wild animal. And when a certain man advised him\nto end his life by fasting, he replied: \"A man may hope for anything while he has life.\" This may be\ntrue; but life is not to be purchased at any price. No matter how great or how well-assured certain\nrewards may be I shall not strive to attain them at the price of a shameful confession of weakness.\nShall I reflect that Fortune has all power over one who lives, rather than reflect that she has no\npower over one who knows how to die? There are times, nevertheless, when a man, even though\ncertain death impends and he knows that torture is in store for him, will refrain from lending a hand\nto his own punishment, to himself, however, he would lend a hand. It is folly to die through fear of\ndying. The executioner is upon you; wait for him. Why anticipate him? Why assume the\nmanagement of a cruel task that belongs to another? Do you grudge your executioner his privilege,\nor do you merely relieve him of his task? Socrates might have ended his life by fasting; he might\nhave died by starvation rather than by poison. But instead of this he spent thirty days in prison\nawaiting death, not with the idea \"everything may happen,\" or \"so long an interval has room for\nmany a hope\" but in order that he might show himself submissive to the laws and make the last\nmoments of Socrates an edification to his friends. What would have been more foolish than to scorn\ndeath, and yet fear poison?", "Scribonia, a woman of the stern old type, was an aunt of Drusus Libo. This young man was as\nstupid as he was well born, with higher ambitions than anyone could have been expected to\nentertain in that epoch, or a man like himself in any epoch at all. When Libo had been carried away\nill from the senate-house in his litter, though certainly with a very scanty train of followers, ? for all\nhis kinsfolk undutifully deserted him, when he was no longer a criminal but a corpse, ? he began to\nconsider whether he should commit suicide, or await death. Scribonia said to him: \"What pleasure\ndo you find in doing another man's work?\" But he did not follow her advice; he laid violent hands\nupon himself. And he was right, after all; for when a man is doomed to die in two or three days at his\nenemy's pleasure, he is really \"doing another man's work\" if he continues to live.", "No general statement can be made, therefore, with regard to the question whether, when a power\nbeyond our control threatens us with death, we should anticipate death, or await it. For there are\nmany arguments to pull us in either direction. If one death is accompanied by torture, and the other\nis simple and easy, why not snatch the latter? Just as I shall select my ship when I am about to go\non a voyage or my house when I propose to take a residence, so I shall choose my death when I am\nabout to depart from life. Moreover, just as a long-drawn out life does not necessarily mean a better\none, so a long-drawn-out death necessarily means a worse one. There is no occasion when the soul\nshould be humoured more than at the moment of death. Let the soul depart as it feels itself impelled\nto go; whether it seeks the sword, or the halter, or some draught that attacks the veins, let it proceed\nand burst the bonds of its slavery. Every man ought to make his life acceptable to others besides\nhimself, but his death to himself alone. The best form of death is the one we like. Men are foolish\nwho reflect thus: \"One person will say that my conduct was not brave enough; another, that I was\ntoo headstrong; a third, that a particular kind of death would have betokened more spirit.\" What you\nshould really reflect is: \"I have under consideration a purpose with which the talk of men has no\nconcern!\" Your sole aim should be to escape from Fortune as\nspeedily as possible; otherwise, there will be no lack of persons who will think ill of what you have\ndone.", "You can find men who have gone so far as to profess wisdom and yet maintain that one should not\noffer violence to one's own life, and hold it accursed for a man to be the means of his own\ndestruction; we should wait, say they, for the end decreed by nature. But one who says this does not\nsee that he is shutting off the path to freedom. The best thing which eternal law ever ordained was\nthat it allowed to us one entrance into life, but many exits. Must I await the cruelty either of disease\nor of man, when I can depart through the midst of torture, and shake off my troubles? This is the one\nreason why we cannot complain of life: it keeps no one against his will. Humanity is well situated,\nbecause no man is unhappy except by his own fault. Live, if you so desire; if not, you may return to\nthe place whence you came. You have often been cupped in order to relieve headaches. You have\nhad veins cut for the purpose of reducing your weight. If you would pierce your heart, a gaping\nwound is not necessary; a lancet will open the way to that great freedom, and tranquillity can be\npurchased at the cost of a pin-prick.", "What, then, is it which makes us lazy and sluggish? None of us reflects that some day he must\ndepart from this house of life; just so old tenants are kept from moving by fondness for a particular\nplace and by custom, even in spite of ill-treatment. Would you be free from the restraint of your\nbody? Live in it as if you were about to leave it. Keep thinking of the fact that some day you will be\ndeprived of this tenure; then you will be more brave against the necessity of departing. But how will\na man take thought of his own end, if he craves all things without end? And yet there is nothing so\nessential for us to consider. For our training in other things is perhaps superfluous. Our souls have\nbeen made ready to meet poverty; but our riches have held out. We have armed ourselves to scorn\npain; but we have had the good fortune to possess sound and healthy bodies, and so have never\nbeen forced to put this virtue to the test. We have taught ourselves to endure bravely the loss of\nthose we love; but Fortune has preserved to us all whom we loved. It is in this one matter only that\nthe day will come which will require us to test our training.", "You need not think that none but great men have had the strength to burst the bonds of human\nservitude; you need not believe that this cannot be done except by a Cato, ? Cato, who with his\nhand dragged forth the spirit which he had not succeeded in freeing by the sword. Nay, men of the\nmeanest lot in life have by a mighty impulse escaped to safety, and when they were not allowed to\ndie at their own convenience, or to suit themselves in their choice of the instruments of death, they\nhave snatched up whatever was lying ready to hand, and by sheer strength have turned objects\nwhich were by nature harmless into weapons of their own. For example, there was lately in a\ntraining-school for wild-beast gladiators a German, who was making ready for the morning\nexhibition; he withdrew in order to relieve himself, ? the only thing which he was allowed to do in\nsecret and without the presence of a guard. While so engaged, he seized the stick of wood, tipped\nwith a sponge, which was devoted to the vilest uses, and stuffed it, just as it was, down his throat;\nthus he blocked up his windpipe, and choked the breath from his body. That was truly to insult\ndeath! Yes, indeed; it was not a very elegant or becoming way to die; but what is more foolish than\nto be over-nice about dying? What a brave fellow! He surely deserved to be allowed to choose his\nfate! How bravely he would have wielded a sword! With what courage he would have hurled himself\ninto the depths of the sea, or down a precipice! Cut off from resources on every hand, he yet found\na way to furnish himself with death, and with a weapon for death. Hence you can understand that\nnothing but the will need postpone death. Let each man judge the deed of this most zealous fellow\nas he likes, provided we agree on this point, ? that the foulest death is preferable to the fairest\nslavery.", "Thou art a little soul bearing about a corpse, as Epictetus used to say.", "Inasmuch as I began with an illustration taken from humble life, I shall keep on with that sort. For\nmen will make greater demands upon themselves, if they see that death can be despised even by\nthe most despised class of men. The Catos, the Scipios, and the others whose names we are wont\nto hear with admiration, we regard as beyond the sphere of imitation; but I shall now prove to you\nthat the virtue of which I speak is found as frequently in the gladiators' training-school as among the\nleaders in a civil war. Lately a gladiator, who had been sent forth to the morning exhibition, was\nbeing conveyed in a cart along with the other prisoners; nodding as if he were heavy with sleep, he\nlet his head fall over so far that it was caught in the spokes; then he kept his body in position long\nenough to break his neck by the revolution of the wheel. So he made his escape by means of the\nvery wagon which was carrying him to his punishment.", "When a man desires to burst forth and take his\ndeparture, nothing stands in his way. It is an open space in which Nature guards us. When our plight\nis such as to permit it, we may look about us for an easy exit. If you have many opportunities ready\nto hand, by means of which you may liberate yourself, you may make a selection and think over the\nbest way of gaining freedom; but if a chance is hard to find, instead of the best, snatch the next best,\neven though it be something unheard of, something new. If you do not lack the courage, you will not\nlack the cleverness, to die. See how even the lowest class of slave, when suffering goads him on, is\naroused and discovers a way to deceive even the most watchful guards! He is truly great who not\nonly has given himself the order to die, but has also found the means.", "I have promised you, however, some more illustrations drawn from the same games. During the\nsecond event in a sham sea-fight one of the barbarians sank deep into his own throat a spear which\nhad been given him for use against his foe. \"Why, oh why,\" he said, \"have I not long ago escaped\nfrom all this torture and all this mockery? Why should I be armed and yet wait for death to come?\"\nThis exhibition was all the more striking because of the lesson men learn from it that dying is more\nhonourable than killing.", "What, then? If such a spirit is possessed by abandoned and dangerous men, shall it not be\npossessed also by those who have trained themselves to meet such contingencies by long\nmeditation, and by reason, the mistress of all things? It is reason which teaches us that fate has\nvarious ways of approach, but the same end, and that it makes no difference at what point the\ninevitable event begins. Reason, too, advises us to die, if we may, according to our taste; if this\ncannot be, she advises us to die according to our ability, and to seize upon whatever means shall\noffer itself for doing violence to ourselves. It is criminal to \"live by robbery\"; but, on the other hand, it\nis most noble to \"die by robbery.\" Farewell.", "You are continually referring special questions to me, forgetting that a vast stretch of sea sunders\nus. Since, however, the value of advice depends mostly on the time when it is given, it must\nnecessarily result that by the time my opinion on certain matters reaches you, the opposite opinion\nis the better. For advice conforms to circumstances; and our circumstances are carried along, or\nrather whirled along. Accordingly, advice should be produced at short notice; and even this is too\nlate; it should \"grow while we work,\" as the saying is. And I propose to show you how you may\ndiscover the method.", "As often as you wish to know what is to be avoided or what is to be sought, consider its relation to\nthe Supreme Good, to the purpose of your whole life. For whatever we do ought to be in harmony\nwith this; no man can set in order the details unless he has already set before himself the chief\npurpose of his life. The artist may have his colours all prepared, but he cannot produce a likeness\nunless he has already made up his mind what he wishes to paint. The reason we make mistakes is\nbecause we all consider the parts of life, but never life as a whole. The archer must know what he is\nseeking to hit; then he must aim and control the weapon by his skill. Our plans miscarry because\nthey have no aim. When a man does not know what harbour he is making for, no wind is the right\nwind. Chance must necessarily have great influence over our lives, because we live by chance. It is\nthe case with certain men, however, that they do not know that they know certain things. Just as we\noften go searching for those who stand beside us, so we are apt to forget that the goal of the\nSupreme Good lies near us.", "To infer the nature of this Supreme Good, one does not need many words or any round-about\ndiscussion; it should be pointed out with the forefinger, so to speak, and not be dissipated into many\nparts. For what good is there in breaking it up into tiny bits, when you can say: the Supreme Good is\nthat which is honourable? Besides (and you may be still more surprised at this), that which is\nhonourable is the only good; all other goods are alloyed and debased. If you once convince yourself\nof this, and if you come to love virtue devotedly (for mere loving is not enough), anything that has\nbeen touched by virtue will be fraught with blessing and prosperity for you, no matter how it shall be\nregarded by others. Torture, if only, as you lie suffering, you are more calm in mind than your very\ntorturer; illness, if only you curse not Fortune and yield not to the disease ? in short, all those things\nwhich others regard as ills will become manageable and will end in good, if you succeed in rising\nabove them.", "Let this once be clear, that there is nothing good except that which is honourable, and all hardships\nwill have a just title to the name of \"goods,\" when\nonce virtue has made them honourable. Many think that we Stoics are holding out expectations\ngreater than our human lot admits of; and they have a right to think so. For they have regard to the\nbody only. But let them turn back to the soul, and they will soon measure man by the standard of\nGod. Rouse yourself, most excellent Lucilius, and leave off all this word-play of the philosophers,\nwho reduce a most glorious subject to a matter of syllables, and lower and wear out the soul by\nteaching fragments; then you will become like the men who discovered these precepts, instead of\nthose who by their teaching do their best to make philosophy seem difficult rather than great.", "Socrates, who recalled the whole of philosophy to rules of conduct, and asserted that the highest\nwisdom consisted in distinguishing between good and evil, said: \"Follow these rules, if my words\ncarry weight with you, in order that you may be happy; and let some men think you even a fool.\nAllow any man who so desires to insult you and work you wrong; but if only virtue dwells with you,\nyou will suffer nothing. If you wish to be happy, if you would be in good faith a good man, let one\nperson or another despise you.\" No man can accomplish this unless he has come to regard all\ngoods as equal, for the reason that no good exists without that which is honourable, and that which\nis honourable is in every case equal. You may say: \"What then? Is there no difference between\nCato's being elected praetor and his failure at the polls? Or whether Cato is conquered or conqueror\nin the battle-line of Pharsalia? And when Cato could not be defeated, though his party met defeat,\nwas not this goodness of his equal to that which would have been his if he had returned victorious to\nhis native land and arranged a peace?\" Of course it was; for it is by the same virtue that evil fortune\nis overcome and good fortune is controlled. Virtue, however, cannot be increased or decreased; its\nstature is uniform. \"But,\" you will object, \"Gnaeus Pompey will lose his army; the patricians, those\nnoblest patterns of the State's creation, and the front-rank men of Pompey's party, a senate under\narms, will be routed in a single engagement; the ruins of that great oligarchy will be scattered all\nover the world; one division will fall in Egypt, another in Africa, and another in Spain! And the poor\nState will not be allowed even the privilege of being ruined once for all!\" Yes, all this may happen;\nJuba's familiarity with every position in his own kingdom may be of no avail to him, of no avail the\nresolute bravery of his people when fighting for their king; even the men of Utica, crushed by their\ntroubles, may waver in their allegiance; and the good fortune which ever attended men of the name\nof Scipio may desert Scipio in Africa. But long ago destiny \"saw to it that Cato should come to no\nharm.\"", "\"He was conquered in spite of it all!\" Well, you may include this among Cato's \"failures\"; Cato will\nbear with an equally stout heart anything that thwarts him of his victory, as he bore that which\nthwarted him of his praetorship. The day whereon he failed of election, he spent in play; the night\nwherein he intended to die, he spent in reading. He regarded in the same light both the loss of his\npraetorship and the loss of his life; he had convinced himself that he ought to endure anything which\nmight happen. Why should he not suffer, bravely and calmly, a change in the government? For what\nis free from the risk of change? Neither earth, nor sky, nor the whole fabric of our universe, though it\nbe controlled by the hand of God. It will not always preserve its present order; it will be thrown from\nits course in days to come. All things move in accord with their appointed times; they are destined to\nbe born, to grow, and to be destroyed. The stars which you see moving above us, and this\nseemingly immovable earth to which we cling and on which we are set, will be consumed and will\ncease to exist. There is nothing that does not have its old age; the intervals are merely unequal at\nwhich Nature sends forth all these things towards the same goal. Whatever is will cease to be, and\nyet it will not perish, but will be resolved into its elements. To our minds, this process means\nperishing, for we behold only that which is nearest; our sluggish mind, under allegiance to the body,\ndoes not penetrate to bournes beyond. Were it not so, the mind would endure with greater courage\nits own ending and that of its possessions, if only it could hope that life and death, like the whole\nuniverse about us, go by turns, that whatever has been put together is broken up again, that\nwhatever has been broken up is put together again, and that the eternal craftsmanship of God, who\ncontrols all things, is working at this task.", "It is no evil for things to undergo change, and no good for things to subsist in consequence of\nchange.", "Therefore the wise man will say just what a Marcus Cato would say, after reviewing his past life:\n\"The whole race of man, both that which is and that which is to be, is condemned to die. Of all the\ncities that at any time have held sway over the world, and of all that have been the splendid\nornaments of empires not their own, men shall some day ask where they were, and they shall be\nswept away\nby destructions of various kinds; some shall be ruined by wars, others shall be wasted away by\ninactivity and by the kind of peace which ends in sloth, or by that vice which is fraught with\ndestruction even for mighty dynasties, ? luxury. All these fertile plains shall be buried out of sight by\na sudden overflowing of the sea, or a slipping of the soil, as it settles to lower levels, shall draw them\nsuddenly into a yawning chasm. Why then should I be angry or feel sorrow, if I precede the general\ndestruction by a tiny interval of time?\" Let great souls comply with God's wishes, and suffer\nunhesitatingly whatever fate the law of the universe ordains; for the soul at death is either sent forth\ninto a better life, destined to dwell with deity amid greater radiance and calm, or else, at least,\nwithout suffering any harm to itself, it will be mingled with nature again, and will return to the\nuniverse.", "Therefore Cato's honourable death was no less a good than his honourable life, since virtue admits\nof no stretching. Socrates used to say that verity and virtue were the same. Just as truth does not\ngrow, so neither does virtue grow; for it has its due proportions and is complete. You need not,\ntherefore, wonder that goods are equal, both those which are to be deliberately chosen, and those\nwhich circumstances have imposed. For if you once adopt the view that they are unequal, deeming,\nfor instance, a brave endurance of torture as among the lesser goods, you will be including it among\nthe evils also; you will pronounce Socrates unhappy in his prison, Cato unhappy when he reopens\nhis wounds with more courage than he showed in inflicting them, and Regulus the most ill-starred of\nall when he pays the penalty for keeping his word even with his enemies. And yet no man, even the\nmost effeminate person in the world, has ever dared to maintain such an opinion. For though such\npersons deny that a man like Regulus is happy, yet for all that they also deny that he is wretched.\nThe earlier Academics do indeed admit that a man is happy even amid such tortures, but do not\nadmit that he is completely or fully happy. With this view we cannot in any wise agree; for unless a\nman is happy, he has not attained the Supreme Good; and the good which is supreme admits of no\nhigher degree, if only virtue exists within this man, and if adversity does not impair his virtue, and if,\nthough the body be injured, the virtue abides unharmed. And it does abide. For I understand virtue\nto be high-spirited and exalted, so that it is aroused by anything that molests it. This spirit, which\nyoung men of noble breeding often assume, when they are so deeply stirred by the beauty of some\nhonourable object that they despise all the gifts of chance, is assuredly infused in us and\ncommunicated to us by wisdom. Wisdom will bring the conviction that there is but one good ? that\nwhich is honourable; that this can neither be shortened nor extended, any more than a carpenter's\nrule, with which straight lines are tested, can be bent. Any change in the rule means spoiling the\nstraight line. Applying, therefore, this same figure to virtue, we shall say: Virtue also is straight, and\nadmits of no bending. What can be made more tense than a thing which is already rigid? Such is\nvirtue, which passes judgment on everything, but nothing passes judgment on virtue. And if this rule,\nvirtue, cannot itself be made more straight, neither can the things created by virtue be in one case", "straighter and in another less straight. For they must necessarily correspond to virtue; hence they\nare equal.", "\"What,\" you say, \"do you call reclining at a banquet and submitting to torture equally good?\" Does\nthis seem surprising to you? You may be still more surprised at the following, ? that reclining at a\nbanquet is an evil, while reclining on the rack is a good, if the former act is done in a shameful, and\nthe latter in an honourable manner. It is not the material that makes these actions good or bad; it is\nthe virtue. All acts in which virtue has disclosed itself are of the same measure and value. At this\nmoment the man who measures the souls of all men by his own is shaking his fist in my face\nbecause I hold that there is a parity between the goods involved in the case of one who passes\nsentence honourably, and of one who suffers sentence honourably; or because I hold that there is a\nparity between the goods of one who celebrates a triumph, and of one who, unconquered in spirit, is\ncarried before the victor's chariot. For such critics think that whatever they themselves cannot do, is\nnot done; they pass judgment on virtue in the light of their own weaknesses. Why do you marvel if it\nhelps a man, and on occasion even pleases him, to be burned, wounded, slain, or bound in prison?\nTo a luxurious man, a simple life is a penalty; to a lazy man, work is punishment; the dandy pities\nthe diligent man; to the slothful, studies are torture. Similarly, we regard those things with respect to\nwhich we are all infirm of disposition, as hard and beyond endurance, forgetting what a torment it is\nto many men to abstain from wine or to be routed from their beds at break of day. These actions are\nnot essentially difficult; it is we ourselves that are soft and flabby. We must pass judgment\nconcerning great matters with greatness of soul; otherwise, that which is really our fault will seem to\nbe their fault. So it is that certain objects which are perfectly straight, when sunk in water appear to\nthe onlooker as bent or broken off. It matters not only what you see, but with what eyes you see it;\nour souls are too dull of vision to perceive the truth. But give me an unspoiled and sturdy-minded\nyoung man; he will pronounce more fortunate one who sustains on unbending shoulders the whole\nweight of adversity, who stands out superior to Fortune. It is not a cause for wonder that one is not\ntossed about when the weather is calm; reserve your wonderment for cases where a man is lifted up\nwhen all others sink, and keeps his footing when all others are prostrate.", "What element of evil is there in torture and in the other things which we call hardships? It seems to\nme that there is this evil, ? that the mind sags, and bends, and collapses. But none of these things\ncan happen to the sage; he stands erect under any load. Nothing can subdue him; nothing that must\nbe endured annoys him. For he does not complain that he has been struck by that which can strike\nany man. He knows his own strength; he knows that he was born to carry burdens. I do not withdraw\nthe wise man from the category of man, nor do I deny to him the sense of pain as though he were a\nrock that has no feelings at all. I remember that he is made up of two parts: the one part is irrational,\n? it is this that may be bitten, burned, or hurt; the other part is rational, ? it is this which holds\nresolutely to opinions, is courageous, and unconquerable. In the latter is situated man's Supreme\nGood. Before this is completely attained, the mind wavers in uncertainty; only when it is fully\nachieved is the mind fixed and steady. And so when one has just begun, or is on one's way to the\nheights and is cultivating virtue, or even if one is drawing near the perfect good but has not yet put\nthe finishing touch upon it, one will retrograde at times and there will be a certain slackening of\nmental effort. For such a man has not yet traversed the doubtful ground; he is still standing in\nslippery places. But the happy man, whose virtue is complete, loves himself most of all when his\nbravery has been submitted to the severest test, and when he not only, endures but welcomes that\nwhich all other men regard with fear, if it is the price which he must pay for the performance of a\nduty which honour imposes, and he greatly prefers to have men say of him: \"how much more noble!\"\nrather than \"how much more lucky!\"", "And now I have reached the point to which your patient waiting summons me. You must not think\nthat our human virtue transcends nature; the wise man will tremble, will feel pain, will turn pale, For\nall these are sensations of the body. Where, then, is the abode of utter distress, of that which is truly\nan evil? In the other part of us, no doubt, if it is the mind that these trials drag down, force to a\nconfession of its servitude, and cause to regret its existence. The wise man, indeed, overcomes\nFortune by his virtue, but many who profess wisdom are sometimes frightened by the most\nunsubstantial threats. And at this stage it is a mistake on our part to make the same demands upon\nthe wise man and upon the learner. I still exhort myself to do that which I recommend; but my\nexhortations are not yet followed. And even if this were the case, I should not have these principles\nso ready for practice, or so well trained, that they would rush to my assistance in every crisis. Just\nas wool takes up certain colours at once, while there are others which it will not absorb unless it is\nsoaked and steeped in them many times; so other systems of doctrine can be immediately applied\nby men's minds after once being accepted, but this system of which I speak, unless it has gone\ndeep and has sunk in for a long time, and has not merely coloured but thoroughly permeated the\nsoul, does not fulfil any of its promises. The matter can be imparted quickly and in very few words:\n\"Virtue is the only good; at any rate there is no good without virtue; and virtue itself is situated in our\nnobler part, that is, the rational part.\" And what will this virtue be? A true and never-swerving\njudgment. For therefrom will spring all mental impulses, and by its agency every external\nappearance that stirs our impulses will be clarified. It will be in keeping with this judgment to judge\nall things that have been coloured by virtue as goods, and as equal goods.", "Bodily goods are, to be sure, good for the body; but they are not absolutely good. There will indeed\nbe some value in them; but they will possess no genuine merit, for they will differ greatly; some will\nbe less, others greater. And we are constrained to acknowledge that there are great differences\namong the very followers of wisdom. One man has already made so much progress that he dares to\nraise his eyes and look Fortune in the face, but not persistently, for his eyes soon drop, dazzled by\nher overwhelming splendour; another has made so much progress that he is able to match glances\nwith her, ? that is, unless he has already reached the summit and is full of confidence. That which is\nshort of perfection must necessarily be unsteady, at one time progressing, at another slipping or\ngrowing faint; and it will surely slip back unless it keeps struggling ahead; for if a man slackens at all\nin zeal and faithful application, he must retrograde. No one can resume his progress at the point\nwhere he left off. Therefore let us press on and persevere. There remains much more of the road\nthan we have put behind us; but the greater part of progress is the desire to progress.", "I fully understand what this task is. It is a thing which I desire, and I desire it with all my heart. I see\nthat you also have been aroused and are hastening with great zeal towards infinite beauty. Let us,\nthen, hasten; only on these terms will life be a boon to us; otherwise, there is delay, and indeed\ndisgraceful delay, while we busy ourselves with revolting things. Let us see to it that all time belongs\nto us. This, however, cannot be unless first of all our own selves begin to belong to us. And when\nwill it be our privilege to despise both kinds of fortune? When will it be our privilege, after all the\npassions have been subdued and brought under our own control, to utter the words \"I have\nconquered!\"? Do you ask me whom I have conquered? Neither the Persians, nor the far-off Medes,\nnor any warlike race that lies beyond the Dahae; not these, but greed, ambition, and the fear of\ndeath that has conquered the conquerors of the world. Farewell.", "The subject concerning which you question me was once clear to my mind, and required no thought,\nso thoroughly had I mastered it. But I have not tested my memory of it for some time, and therefore\nit does not readily come back to me. I feel that I have suffered the fate of a book whose rolls have\nstuck together by disuse; my mind needs to be unrolled, and whatever has been stored away there\nought to be examined from time to time, so that it may be ready for use when occasion demands.\nLet us therefore put this subject off for the present; for it demands much labour and much care. As\nsoon as I can hope to stay for any length of time in the same place, I shall then take your question in\nhand. For there are certain subjects about which you can write even while travelling in a gig, and\nthere are also subjects which need a study-chair, and quiet, and seclusion. Nevertheless I ought to\naccomplish something even on days like these, ? days which are fully employed, and indeed from\nmorning till night. For there is never a moment when fresh employments will not come along; we\nsow them, and for this reason several spring up from one. Then, too, we keep adjourning our own\ncases, saying: \"As soon as I am done with this, I shall settle down to hard work,\" or: \"If I ever set this\ntroublesome matter in order, I shall devote myself to study.\"", "But the study of philosophy is not to be postponed until you have leisure; everything else is to be\nneglected in order that we may attend to philosophy, for no amount of time is long enough for it,\neven though our lives be prolonged from boyhood to the uttermost bounds of time allotted to man. It\nmakes little difference whether you leave philosophy out altogether or study it intermittently; for it\ndoes not stay as it was when you dropped it, but, because its continuity has been broken, it goes\nback to the position in which it was at the beginning, like things which fly apart when they are\nstretched taut. We must resist the affairs which occupy our time; they must not be untangled, but\nrather put out of the way. Indeed, there is no time that is unsuitable for helpful studies; and yet many\na man fails to study amid the very circumstances which make study necessary. He says:\n\"Something will happen to hinder me.\" No, not in the case of the man whose spirit, no matter what\nhis business may be, is happy and alert. It is those who are still short of perfection whose happiness\ncan be broken off; the joy of a wise man, on the other hand, is a woven fabric, rent by no chance\nhappening and by no change of fortune; at all times and in all places he is at peace. For his joy\ndepends on nothing external and looks for no boon from man or fortune. His happiness is something\nwithin himself; it would depart from his soul if it entered in from the outside; it is born there.\nSometimes an external happening reminds him of his mortality, but it is a light blow, and merely\ngrazes the surface of his skin. Some trouble, I repeat, may touch him like a breath of wind, but that\nSupreme Good of his is unshaken. This is what I mean: there are external disadvantages, like\npimples and boils that break out upon a body which is normally strong and sound; but there is no\ndeep-seated malady. The difference, I say, between a man of perfect wisdom and another who is\nprogressing in wisdom is the same as the difference between a healthy man and one who is\nconvalescing from a severe and lingering illness, for whom \"health\" means only a lighter attack of\nhis disease. If the latter does not take heed, there is an immediate relapse and a return to the same\nold trouble; but the wise man cannot slip back, or slip into any more illness at all. For health of body\nis a temporary matter which the physician cannot guarantee, even though he has restored it; nay, he\nis often roused from his bed to visit the same patient who summoned him before. The mind,", "I shall tell you what I mean by health: if the mind is content with its own self; if it has confidence in\nitself; if it understands that all those things for which men pray, all the benefits which are bestowed\nand sought for, are of no importance in relation to a life of happiness; under such conditions it is\nsound. For anything that can be added to is imperfect; anything that can suffer loss is not lasting;\nbut let the man whose happiness is to be lasting, rejoice in what is truly his own. Now all that which\nthe crowd gapes after, ebbs and flows. Fortune gives us nothing which we can really own. But even\nthese gifts of Fortune please us when reason has tempered and blended them to our taste; for it is\nreason which makes acceptable to us even external goods that are disagreeable to use if we absorb\nthem too greedily. Attalus used to employ the following simile: \"Did you ever see a dog snapping\nwith wide-open jaws at bits of bread or meat which his master tosses to him? Whatever he catches,\nhe straightway swallows whole, and always opens his jaws in the hope of something more. So it is\nwith ourselves; we stand expectant, and whatever Fortune has thrown to us we forthwith bolt,\nwithout any real pleasure, and then stand alert and frantic for something else to snatch.\" But it is not\nso with the wise man; he is satisfied. Even if something falls to him, he merely accepts it carelessly\nand lays it aside. The happiness that he enjoys is supremely great, is lasting, is his own. Assume\nthat a man has good intentions, and has made progress, but is still far from the heights; the result is\na series of ups and downs; he is now raised to heaven, now brought down to earth. For those who\nlack experience and training, there is no limit to the downhill course; such a one falls into the Chaos\nof Epicurus, ? empty and boundless. There is still a third class of men, ? those who toy with wisdom;\nthey have not indeed touched it, but yet are in sight of it, and have it, so to speak, within striking\ndistance. They are not dashed about, nor do they drift back either; they are not on dry land, but are\nalready in port.", "Time is like a river made up of the events which happen, and a violent stream; for as soon as a thing\nhas been seen, it is carried away, and another comes in its place, and this will be carried away too.", "Therefore, considering the great difference between those on the heights and those in the depths,\nand seeing that even those in the middle are pursued by an ebb and flow peculiar to their state and\npursued also by an enormous risk of returning to their degenerate ways, we should not give\nourselves up to matters which occupy our time. They should be shut out; if they once gain an\nentrance, they will bring in still others to take their places. Let us resist them in their early stages. It\nis better that they shall never begin than that they shall be made to cease. Farewell.", "It seems to me erroneous to believe that those who have loyally dedicated themselves to philosophy\nare stubborn and rebellious, scorners of magistrates or kings or of those who control the\nadministration of public affairs. For, on the contrary, no class of man is so popular with the\nphilosopher as the ruler is; and rightly so, because rulers bestow upon no men a greater privilege\nthan upon those who are allowed to enjoy peace and leisure. Hence, those who are greatly profited,\nas regards their purpose of right living, by the security of the State, must needs cherish as a father\nthe author of this good; much more so, at any rate, than those restless persons who are always in\nthe public eye, who owe much to the ruler, but also expect much from him, and are never so\ngenerously loaded with favours that their cravings, which grow by being supplied, are thoroughly\nsatisfied. And yet he whose thoughts are of benefits to come has forgotten the benefits received;\nand there is no greater evil in covetousness than its ingratitude. Besides, no man in public life thinks\nof the many whom he has outstripped; he thinks rather of those by whom he is outstripped. And\nthese men find it less pleasing to see many behind them than annoying to see anyone ahead of\nthem. That is the trouble with every sort of ambition; it does not look back. Nor is it ambition alone\nthat is fickle, but also every sort of craving, because it always begins where it ought to end.", "But that other man, upright and pure, who has left the senate and the bar and all affairs of state, that\nhe may retire to nobler affairs, cherishes those who have made it possible for him to do this in\nsecurity; he is the only person who returns spontaneous thanks to them, the only person who owes\nthem a great debt without their knowledge. Just as a man honours and reveres his teachers, by\nwhose aid he has found release from his early wanderings, so the sage honours these men, also,\nunder whose guardianship he can put his good theories into practice. But you answer: \"Other men\ntoo are protected by a king's personal power.\" Perfectly true. But just as, out of a number of persons\nwho have profited by the same stretch of calm weather, a man deems that his debt to Neptune is\ngreater if his cargo during that voyage has been more extensive and valuable, and just as the vow is\npaid with more of a will by the merchant than by the passenger, and just as, from among the\nmerchants themselves, heartier thanks are uttered by the dealer in spices, purple fabrics, and\nobjects worth their weight in gold, than by him who has gathered cheap merchandise that will be\nnothing but ballast for his ship; similarly, the benefits of this peace, which extends to all, are more\ndeeply appreciated by those who make good use of it.", "For there are many of our toga-clad citizens to whom peace brings more trouble than war. Or do\nthose, think you, owe as much as we do for the peace they enjoy, who spend it in drunkenness, or\nin lust, or in other vices which it were worth even a war to interrupt? No, not unless you think that the\nwise man is so unfair as to believe that as an individual he owes nothing in return for the\nadvantages which he enjoys with all the rest. I owe a great debt to the sun and to the moon; and yet\nthey do not rise for me alone. I am personally beholden to the seasons and to the god who controls\nthem, although in no respect have they been apportioned for my benefit. The foolish greed of\nmortals makes a distinction between possession and ownership, and believes that it has ownership\nin nothing in which the general public has a share. But our philosopher considers nothing more truly\nhis own than that which he shares in partnership with all mankind. For these things would not be\ncommon property, as indeed they are, unless every individual had his quota; even a joint interest\nbased upon the slightest share makes one a partner. Again, the great and true goods are not\ndivided in such a manner that each has but a slight interest; they belong in their entirety to each\nindividual. At a distribution of grain men receive only the amount that has been promised to each\nperson; the banquet and the meat-dole, or all else that a man can carry away with him, are divided\ninto parts. These goods, however, are indivisible, ? I mean peace and liberty, ? and they belong in\ntheir entirety to all men just as much as they belong to each individual.", "Therefore the philosopher thinks of the person who makes it possible for him to use and enjoy these\nthings, of the person who exempts him when the state's dire need summons to arms, to sentry duty,\nto the defence of the walls, and to the manifold exactions of war; and he gives thanks to the\nhelmsman of his state. This is what philosophy teaches most of all, ? honourably to avow the debt of\nbenefits received, and honourably to pay them; sometimes, however, the acknowledgment itself\nconstitutes payment. Our philosopher will therefore acknowledge that he owes a large debt to the\nruler who makes it possible, by his management and foresight, for him to enjoy rich leisure, control\nof his own time, and a tranquillity uninterrupted by public employments.", "And if even such leisure as that of our poet owes a great debt to its author, though its greatest boon\nis this:", "He let me turn my cattle out to feed,\nAnd play what fancy pleased on rustic reed;", "how highly are we to value this leisure of the philosopher, which is spent among the gods, and\nmakes us gods? Yes, that is what I mean, Lucilius; and I invite you to heaven by a short cut.", "Sextius used to say that Jupiter had no more power than the good man. Of course, Jupiter has more\ngifts which he can offer to mankind; but when you are choosing between two good men, the richer is\nnot necessarily the better, any more than, in the case of two pilots of equal skill in managing the\ntiller, you would call him the better whose ship is larger and more imposing. In what respect is\nJupiter superior to our good man? His goodness lasts longer; but the wise man does not set a lower\nvalue upon himself, just because his virtues are limited by a briefer span. Or take two wise men; he\nwho has died at a greater age is not happier than he whose virtue has been limited to fewer years:\nsimilarly, a god has no advantage over a wise man in point of happiness, even though he has such\nan advantage in point of years. That virtue is not greater which lasts longer. Jupiter possesses all\nthings, but he has surely given over the possession of them to others; the only use of them which\nbelongs to him is this: he is the cause of their use to all men. The wise man surveys and scorns all\nthe possessions of others as calmly as does Jupiter, and regards himself with the greater esteem\nbecause, while Jupiter cannot make use of them, he, the wise man, does not wish to do so. Let us\ntherefore believe Sextius when he shows us the path of perfect beauty, and cries: \"This is 'the way\nto the stars'; this is the way, by observing thrift, self-restraint, and courage!\"", "The gods are not disdainful or envious; they open the door to you; they lend a hand as you climb.\nDo you marvel that man goes to the gods? God comes to men; nay, he comes nearer, ? he comes\ninto men. No mind that has not God, is good. Divine seeds are scattered throughout our mortal\nbodies; if a good husbandman receives them, they spring up in the likeness of their source and of a\nparity with those from which they came. If, however, the husbandman be bad, like a barren or\nmarshy soil, he kills the seeds, and causes tares to grow up instead of wheat. Farewell.", "Everything which happens is as familiar and well known as the rose in spring and the fruit in\nsummer; for such is disease, and death, and calumny, and treachery, and whatever else delights\nfools or vexes them.", "Your letter has given me pleasure, and has roused me from sluggishness. It has also prompted my\nmemory, which has been for some time slack and nerveless.", "You are right, of course, my dear Lucilius, in deeming the chief means of attaining the happy life to\nconsist in the belief that the only good lies in that which is honourable. For anyone who deems other\nthings to be good, puts himself in the power of Fortune, and goes under the control of another; but\nhe who has in every case defined the good by the honourable, is happy with an inward happiness.", "One man is saddened when his children die; another is anxious when they become ill; a third is\nembittered when they do something disgraceful, or suffer a taint in their reputation. One man, you\nwill observe, is tortured by passion for his neighbour's wife, another by passion for his own. You will\nfind men who are completely upset by failure to win an election, and others who are actually\nplagued by the offices which they have won. But the largest throng of unhappy men among the host\nof mortals are those whom the expectation of death, which threatens them on every hand, drives to\ndespair. For there is no quarter from which death may not approach. Hence, like soldiers scouting in\nthe enemy's country, they must look about in all directions, and turn their heads at every sound;\nunless the breast be rid of this fear, one lives with a palpitating heart. You will readily recall those\nwho have been driven into exile and dispossessed of their property. You will also recall (and this is\nthe most serious kind of destitution) those who are poor in the midst of their riches. You will recall\nmen who have suffered shipwreck, or those whose sufferings resemble shipwreck; for they were\nuntroubled and at ease, when the anger or perhaps the envy of the populace, ? a missile most\ndeadly to those in high places, ? dismantled them like a storm which is wont to rise when one is\nmost confident of continued calm, or like a sudden stroke of lightning which even causes the region\nround about it to tremble. For just as anyone who stands near the bolt is stunned and resembles\none who is struck, so in these sudden and violent mishaps, although but one person is overwhelmed\nby the disaster, the rest are overwhelmed by fear, and the possibility that they may suffer makes\nthem as downcast as the actual sufferer.", "Every man is troubled in spirit by evils that come suddenly upon his neighbour. Like birds, who\ncower even at the whirr of an empty sling, we are distracted by mere sounds as well as by blows. No\nman therefore can be happy if he yields himself up to such foolish fancies. For nothing brings\nhappiness unless it also brings calm; it is a bad sort of existence that is spent in apprehension.\nWhoever has largely surrendered himself to the power of Fortune has made for himself a huge web\nof disquietude, from which he cannot get free; if one would win a way to safety, there is but one\nroad, ? to despise externals and to be contented with that which is honourable. For those who\nregard anything as better than virtue, or believe that there is any good except virtue, are spreading\ntheir arms to gather in that which Fortune tosses abroad, and are anxiously awaiting her favours.\nPicture now to yourself that Fortune is holding a festival, and is showering down honours, riches,\nand influence upon this mob of mortals; some of these gifts have already been torn to pieces in the\nhands of those who try to snatch them, others have been divided up by treacherous partnerships,\nand still others have been seized to the great detriment of those into whose possession they have\ncome. Certain of these favours have fallen to men while they were absent-minded; others have\nbeen lost to their seekers because they were snatching too eagerly for them, and, just because they\nare greedily seized upon, have been knocked from their hands. There is not a man among them all,\nhowever, ? even he who has been lucky in the booty which has fallen to him, ? whose joy in his\nspoil has lasted until the morrow.", "The most sensible man, therefore, as soon as he sees the dole being brought in, runs from the\ntheatre; for he knows that one pays a high price for small favours. No one will grapple with him on\nthe way out, or strike him as he departs; the quarrelling takes place where the prizes are. Similarly\nwith the gifts which Fortune tosses down to us; wretches that we are, we become excited, we are\ntorn asunder, we wish that we had many hands, we look back now in this direction and now in that.\nAll too slowly, as it seems, are the gifts thrown in our direction; they merely excite our cravings,\nsince they can reach but few and are awaited by all. We are keen to intercept them as they fall\ndown. We rejoice if we have laid hold of anything; and some have been mocked by the idle hope of\nlaying hold; we have either paid a high price for worthless plunder with some disadvantage to\nourselves, or else have been defrauded and are left in the lurch. Let us therefore withdraw from a\ngame like this, and give way to the greedy rabble; let them gaze after such \"goods,\" which hang\nsuspended above them, and be themselves still more in suspense.", "Whoever makes up his mind to be happy should conclude that the good consists only in that which\nis honourable. For if he regards anything else as good, he is, in the first place, passing an\nunfavourable judgment upon Providence because of the fact that upright men often suffer\nmisfortunes, and that the time which is allotted to us is but short and scanty, if you compare it with\nthe eternity which is allotted to the universe.", "It is a result of complaints like these that we are unappreciative in our comments upon the gifts of\nheaven; we complain because they are not always granted to us, because they are few and unsure\nand fleeting. Hence we have not the will either to live or to die; we are possessed by hatred of life,\nby fear of death. Our plans are all at sea, and no amount of prosperity can satisfy us. And the\nreason for all this is that we have not yet attained to that good which is immeasurable and\nunsurpassable, in which all wishing on our part must cease, because there is no place beyond the\nhighest. Do you ask why virtue needs nothing? Because it is pleased with what it has, and does not\nlust after that which it has not. Whatever is enough is abundant in the eyes of virtue.", "Dissent from this judgment, and duty and loyalty will not abide. For one who desires to exhibit these\ntwo qualities must endure much that the world calls evil; we must sacrifice many things to which we\nare addicted, thinking them to be goods. Gone is courage, which should be continually testing itself;\ngone is greatness of soul, which cannot stand out clearly unless it has learned to scorn as trivial\neverything that the crowd covets as supremely important; and gone is kindness and the repaying of\nkindness, if we fear toil, if we have acknowledged anything to be more precious than loyalty, if our\neyes are fixed upon anything except the best.", "In the series of things those which follow are always aptly fitted to those which have gone before; for\nthis series is not like a mere enumeration of disjointed things, which has only a necessary sequence,\nbut it is a rational connection: and as all existing things are arranged together harmoniously, so the\nthings which come into existence exhibit no mere succession, but a certain wonderful relationship.", "But to pass these questions by: either these so-called goods are not goods, or else man is more\nfortunate than God, because God has no enjoyment of the things which are given to us. For lust\npertains not to God, nor do elegant banquets, nor wealth, nor any of the things that allure mankind\nand lead him on through the influence of degrading pleasure. Therefore, it is, either not incredible\nthat there are goods which God does not possess, or else the very fact that God does not possess\nthem is in itself a proof that these things are not goods. Besides, many things which are wont to be\nregarded as goods are granted to animals in fuller measure than to men. Animals eat their food with\nbetter appetite, are not in the same degree weakened by sexual indulgence, and have a greater and\nmore uniform constancy in their strength. Consequently, they are much more fortunate than man.\nFor there is no wickedness, no injury to themselves, in their way of living. They enjoy their pleasures\nand they take them more often and more easily, without any of the fear that results from shame or\nregret.", "This being so, you should consider whether one has a right to call anything good in which God is\noutdone by man. Let us limit the Supreme Good to the soul; it loses its meaning if it is taken from\nthe best part of us and applied to the worst, that is, if it is transferred to the senses; for the senses\nare more active in dumb beasts. The sum total of our happiness must not be placed in the flesh; the\ntrue goods are those which reason bestows, substantial and eternal; they cannot fall away, neither\ncan they grow less or be diminished. Other things are goods according to opinion, and though they\nare called by the same name as the true goods, the essence of goodness is not in them. Let us\ntherefore call them \"advantages,\" and, to use our technical term, \"preferred\" things. Let us, however,\nrecognize that they are our chattels, not parts of ourselves; and let us have them in our possession,\nbut take heed to remember that they are outside ourselves. Even though they are in our possession,\nthey are to be reckoned as things subordinate and poor, the possession of which gives no man a\nright to plume himself. For what is more foolish than being self-complacent about something which\none has not accomplished by one's own efforts? Let everything of this nature be added to us, and\nnot stick fast to us, so that, if it is withdrawn, it may come away without tearing off any part of us. Let\nus use these things, but not boast of them, and let us use them sparingly, as if they were given for\nsafe-keeping and will be withdrawn. Anyone who does not employ reason in his possession of them\nnever keeps them long; for prosperity of itself, if uncontrolled by reason, overwhelms itself. If anyone\nhas put his trust in goods that are most fleeting, he is soon bereft of them, and, to avoid being\nbereft, he suffers distress. Few men have been permitted to lay aside prosperity gently. The rest all\nfall, together with the things amid which they have come into eminence, and they are weighted down\nby the very things which had before exalted them. For this reason foresight must be brought into\nplay, to insist upon a limit or upon frugality in the use of these things, since licence overthrows and\ndestroys its own abundance. That which has no limit has never endured, unless reason, which sets\nlimits, has held it in check. The fate of many cities will prove the truth of this; their sway has ceased\nat the very prime because they were given to luxury, and excess has ruined all that had been won\nby virtue. We should fortify ourselves against such calamities. But no wall can be erected against", "Fortune which she cannot take by storm; let us strengthen our inner defences. If the inner part be\nsafe, man can be attacked, but never captured.", "Do you wish to know what this weapon of defence is? It is the ability to refrain from chafing over\nwhatever happens to one, of knowing that the very agencies which seem to bring harm are working\nfor the preservation of the world, and are a part of the scheme for bringing to fulfilment the order of\nthe universe and its functions. Let man be pleased with whatever has pleased God; let him marvel\nat himself and his own resources for this very reason, that he cannot be overcome, that he has the\nvery powers of evil subject to his control, and that he brings into subjection chance and pain and\nwrong by means of that strongest of powers ? reason. Love reason! The love of reason will arm you\nagainst the greatest hardships. Wild beasts dash against the hunter's spear through love of their\nyoung, and it is their wildness and their unpremeditated onrush that keep them from being tamed;\noften a desire for glory has stirred the mind of youth to despise both sword and stake; the mere\nvision and semblance of virtue impel certain men to a self-imposed death. In proportion as reason is\nstouter and steadier than any of these emotions, so much the more forcefully will she make her way\nthrough the midst of utter terrors and dangers.", "Men say to us: \"You are mistaken if you maintain that nothing is a good except that which is\nhonourable; a defence like this will not make you safe from Fortune and free from her assaults. For\nyou maintain that dutiful children, and a well-governed country, and good parents, are to be\nreckoned as goods; but you cannot see these dear objects in danger and be yourself at ease. Your\ncalm will be disturbed by a siege conducted against your country, by the death of your children, or\nby the enslaving of your parents.\" I will first state what we Stoics usually reply to these objectors,\nand then will add what additional answer should, in my opinion, be given.", "The situation is entirely different in the case of goods whose loss entails some hardship substituted\nin their place; for example, when good health is impaired there is a change to ill-health; when the\neye is put out, we are visited with blindness; we not only lose our speed when our leg-muscles are\ncut, but infirmity takes the place of speed. But no such danger is involved in the case of the goods to\nwhich we referred a moment ago. And why? If I have lost a good friend, I have no false friend whom\nI must endure in his place; nor if I have buried a dutiful son, must I face in exchange unfilial conduct.\nIn the second place, this does not mean to me the taking-off of a friend or of a child; it is the mere\ntaking-off of their bodies. But a good can be lost in only one way, by changing into what is bad; and\nthis is impossible according to the law of nature, because every virtue, and every work of virtue,\nabides uncorrupted. Again, even if friends have perished, or children of approved goodness who\nfulfil their father's prayers for them, there is something that can fill their place. Do you ask what this\nis? It is that which had made them good in the first place, namely, virtue. Virtue suffers no space in\nus to be unoccupied; it takes possession of the whole soul and removes all sense of loss. It alone is\nsufficient; for the strength and beginnings of all goods exist in virtue herself. What does it matter if\nrunning water is cut off and flows away, as long as the fountain from which it has flowed is\nunharmed? You will not maintain that a man's life is more just if his children are unharmed than if\nthey have passed away, nor yet better appointed, nor more intelligent, nor more honourable;\ntherefore, no better, either. The addition of friends does not make one wiser, nor does their taking\naway make one more foolish; therefore, not happier or more wretched, either. As long as your virtue\nis unharmed, you will not feel the loss of anything that has been withdrawn from you. You may say:\n\"Come now; is not a man happier when girt about with a large company of friends and children?\"\nWhy should this be so? For the Supreme Good is neither impaired nor increased thereby; it abides\nwithin its own limits, no matter how Fortune has conducted herself. Whether a long old age falls to\none's lot, or whether the end comes on this side of old age ? the measure of the Supreme Good is\nunvaried, in spite of the difference in years.", "Whether you draw a larger or a smaller circle, its size affects its area, not its shape. One circle may\nremain as it is for a long time while you may contract the other forthwith, or even merge it completely\nwith the sand in which it was drawn; yet each circle has had the same shape. That which is straight\nis not judged by its size, or by its number, or by its duration; it can no more be made longer than it\ncan be made shorter. Scale down the honourable life as much as you like from the full hundred\nyears, and reduce it to a single day; it is equally honourable. Sometimes virtue is widespread,\ngoverning kingdoms, cities, and provinces, creating laws, developing friendships, and regulating the\nduties that hold good between relatives and children; at other times it is limited by the narrow\nbounds of poverty, exile, or bereavement. But it is no smaller when it is reduced from prouder\nheights to a private station, from a royal palace to a humble dwelling, or when from a general and\nbroad jurisdiction it is gathered into the narrow limits of a private house or a tiny corner. Virtue is just\nas great, even when it has retreated within itself and is shut in on all sides. For its spirit is no less\ngreat and upright, its sagacity no less complete, its justice no less inflexible. It is, therefore, equally\nhappy. For happiness has its abode in one place only, namely, in the mind itself, and is noble,\nsteadfast, and calm; and this state cannot be attained without a knowledge of things divine and\nhuman.", "The other answer, which I promised to make to your objection, follows from this reasoning. The wise\nman is not distressed by the loss of children or of friends. For he endures their death in the same\nspirit in which he awaits his own. And he fears the one as little as he grieves for the other. For the\nunderlying principle of virtue is conformity; all the works of virtue are in harmony and agreement with\nvirtue itself. But this harmony is lost if the soul, which ought to be uplifted, is cast down by grief or a\nsense of loss. It is ever a dishonour for a man to be troubled and fretted, to be numbed when there\nis any call for activity. For that which is honourable is free from care and untrammelled, is unafraid,\nand stands girt for action. \"What,\" you ask, \"will the wise man experience no emotion like\ndisturbance of spirit? Will not his features change colour, his countenance be agitated, and his limbs\ngrow cold? And there are other things which we do, not under the influence of the will, but\nunconsciously and as the result of a sort of natural impulse.\" I admit that this is true; but the sage\nwill retain the firm belief that none of these things is evil, or important enough to make a healthy\nmind break down. Whatever shall remain to be done virtue can do with courage and readiness. For\nanyone would admit that it is a mark of folly to do in a slothful and rebellious spirit whatever one has\nto do, or to direct the body in one direction and the mind in another, and thus to be torn between\nutterly conflicting emotions. For folly is despised precisely because of the things for which she\nvaunts and admires herself, and she does not do gladly even those things in which she prides\nherself. But if folly fears some evil, she is burdened by it in the very moment of awaiting it, just as if it\nhad actually come, ? already suffering in apprehension whatever she fears she may suffer. Just as\nin the body symptoms of latent ill-health precede the disease ? there is, for example, a certain weak\nsluggishness, a lassitude which is not the result of any work, a trembling, and a shivering that\npervades the limbs, ? so the feeble spirit is shaken by its ills a long time before it is overcome by\nthem. It anticipates them, and totters before its time.", "But what is greater madness than to be tortured by the future and not to save your strength for the\nactual suffering, but to invite and bring on wretchedness? If you cannot be rid of it, you ought at\nleast to postpone it. Will you not understand that no man should be tormented by the future? The\nman who has been told that he will have to endure torture fifty years from now is not disturbed\nthereby, unless he has leaped over the intervening years, and has projected himself into the trouble\nthat is destined to arrive a generation later. In the same way, souls that enjoy being sick and that\nseize upon excuses for sorrow are saddened by events long past and effaced from the records.\nPast and future are both absent; we feel neither of them. But there can be no pain except as the\nresult of what you feel. Farewell.", "You have been complaining that my letters to you are rather carelessly written. Now who talks\ncarefully unless he also desires to talk affectedly? I prefer that my letters should be just what my\nconversation would be if you and I were sitting in one another's company or taking walks together, ?\nspontaneous and easy; for my letters have nothing strained or artificial about them. If it were\npossible, I should prefer to show, rather than speak, my feelings. Even if I were arguing a point, I\nshould not stamp my foot, or toss my arms about, or raise my voice; but I should leave that sort of\nthing to the orator, and should be content to have conveyed my feelings to you without having either\nembellished them or lowered their dignity. I should like to convince you entirely of this one fact, ?\nthat I feel whatever I say, that I not only feel it, but am wedded to it. It is one sort of kiss which a man\ngives his mistress, and another which he gives his children; yet in the father's embrace also, holy\nand restrained as it is, plenty of affection is disclosed.", "I prefer, however, that our conversation on matters so important should not be meagre and dry; for\neven philosophy does not renounce the company of cleverness. One should not, however, bestow\nvery much attention upon mere words. Let this be the kernel of my idea: let us say what we feel, and\nfeel what we say; let speech harmonize with life. That man has fulfilled his promise who is the same\nperson both when you see him and when you hear him. We shall not fail to see what sort of man he\nis and how large a man he is, if only he is one and the same. Our words should aim not to please,\nbut to help. If, however, you can attain eloquence without painstaking, and if you either are naturally\ngifted or can gain eloquence at slight cost, make the most of it and apply it to the noblest uses. But\nlet it be of such a kind that it displays facts rather than itself. It and the other arts are wholly\nconcerned with cleverness; but our business here is the soul.", "Always remember the saying of Heraclitus, that the death of earth is to become water, and the death\nof water is to become air, and the death of air is to become fire, and reversely. And think too of him\nwho forgets whither the way leads, and that men quarrel with that with which they are most\nconstantly in communion, the reason which governs the universe; and the things which daily meet\nwith seem to them strange: and consider that we ought not to act and speak as if we were asleep,\nfor even in sleep we seem to act and speak; and that we ought not, like children who learn from their\nparents, simply to act and speak as we have been taught.", "A sick man does not call in a physician who is eloquent; but if it so happens that the physician who\ncan cure him likewise discourses elegantly about the treatment which is to be followed, the patient\nwill take it in good part. For all that, he will not find any reason to congratulate himself on having\ndiscovered a physician who is eloquent. For the case is no different from that of a skilled pilot who is\nalso handsome. Why do you tickle my ears? Why do you entertain me? There is other business at\nhand; I am to be cauterized, operated upon, or put on a diet. That is why you were summoned to\ntreat me!", "You are required to cure a disease that is chronic and serious, ? one which affects the general weal.\nYou have as serious a business on hand as a physician has during a plague. Are you concerned\nabout words? Rejoice this instant if you can cope with things. When shall you learn all that there is\nto learn? When shall you so plant in your mind that which you have learned, that it cannot escape?\nWhen shall you put it all into practice? For it is not sufficient merely to commit these things to\nmemory, like other matters; they must be practically tested. He is not happy who only knows them,\nbut he who does them. You reply: \"What? Are there no degrees of happiness below your 'happy'\nman? Is there a sheer descent immediately below wisdom?\" I think not. For though he who makes\nprogress is still numbered with the fools, yet he is separated from them by a long interval. Among\nthe very persons who are making progress there are also great spaces intervening. They fall into\nthree classes, as certain philosophers believe. First come those who have not yet attained wisdom\nbut have already gained a place near by. Yet even that which is not far away is still outside. These,\nif you ask me, are men who have already laid aside all passions and vices, who have learned what\nthings are to be embraced; but their assurance is not yet tested. They have not yet put their good\ninto practice, yet from now on they cannot slip back into the faults which they have escaped. They\nhave already arrived at a point from which there is no slipping back, but they are not yet aware of\nthe fact; as I remember writing in another letter, \"They are ignorant of their knowledge.\" It has now\nbeen vouchsafed to them to enjoy their good, but not yet to be sure of it. Some define this class, of\nwhich I have been speaking, ? a class of men who are making progress, ? as having escaped the\ndiseases of the mind, but not yet the passions, and as still standing upon slippery ground; because\nno one is beyond the dangers of evil except him who has cleared himself of it wholly. But no one\nhas so cleared himself except the man who has adopted wisdom in its stead.", "I have often before explained the difference between the diseases of the mind and its passions. And\nI shall remind you once more: the diseases are hardened and chronic vices, such as greed and\nambition; they have enfolded the mind in too close a grip, and have begun to be permanent evils\nthereof. To give a brief definition: by \"disease\" we mean a persistent perversion of the judgment, so\nthat things which are mildly desirable are thought to be highly desirable. Or, if you prefer, we may\ndefine it thus: to be too zealous in striving for things which are only mildly desirable or not desirable\nat all, or to value highly things which ought to be valued but slightly or valued not at all. \"Passions\"\nare objectionable impulses of the spirit, sudden and vehement; they have come so often, and so\nlittle attention has been paid to them, that they have caused a state of disease; just as a catarrh,\nwhen there has been but a single attack and the catarrh has not yet become habitual, produces a\ncough, but causes consumption when it has become regular and chronic. Therefore we may say\nthat those who have made most progress are beyond the reach of the \"diseases\"; but they still feel\nthe \"passions\" even when very near perfection.", "The second class is composed of those who have laid aside both the greatest ills of the mind and its\npassions, but yet are not in assured possession of immunity. For they can still slip back into their\nformer state. The third class are beyond the reach of many of the vices and particularly of the great\nvices, but not beyond the reach of all. They have escaped avarice, for example, but still feel anger;\nthey no longer are troubled by lust, but are still troubled by ambition; they no longer have desire, but\nthey still have fear. And just because they fear, although they are strong enough to withstand certain\nthings, there are certain things to which they yield; they scorn death, but are in terror of pain.", "Let us reflect a moment on this topic. It will be well with us if we are admitted to this class. The\nsecond stage is gained by great good fortune with regard to our natural gifts and by great and\nunceasing application to study. But not even the third type is to be despised. Think of the host of\nevils which you see about you; behold how there is no crime that is not exemplified, how far\nwickedness advances every day, and how prevalent are sins in home and commonwealth. You will\nsee, therefore, that we are making a considerable gain, if we are not numbered among the basest.", "\"But as for me,\" you say, \"I hope that it is in me to rise to a higher rank than that!\" I should pray,\nrather than promise, that we may attain this; we have been forestalled. We hasten towards virtue\nwhile hampered by vices. I am ashamed to say it; but we worship that which is honourable only in so\nfar as we have time to spare. But what a rich reward awaits us if only we break off the affairs which\nforestall us and the evils that cling to us with utter tenacity! Then neither desire nor fear shall rout us.\nUndisturbed by fears, unspoiled by pleasures, we shall be afraid neither of death nor of the gods; we\nshall know that death is no evil and that the gods are not powers of evil. That which harms has no\ngreater power than that which receives harm, and things which are utterly good have no power at all\nto harm. There await us, if ever we escape from these low dregs to that sublime and lofty height,\npeace of mind and, when all error has been driven out, perfect liberty. You ask what this freedom is?\nIt means not fearing either men or gods; it means not craving wickedness or excess; it means\npossessing supreme power over oneself And it is a priceless good to be master of oneself. Farewell.", "You have been threatening me with your enmity, if I do not keep you informed about all my daily\nactions. But see, now, upon what frank terms you and I live: for I shall confide even the following\nfact to your ears. I have been hearing the lectures of a philosopher; four days have already passed\nsince I have been attending his school and listening to the harangue, which begins at two o'clock. \"A\nfine time of life for that!\" you say. Yes, fine indeed! Now what is more foolish than refusing to learn,\nsimply because one has not been learning for a long time? \"What do you mean? Must I follow the\nfashion set by the fops and youngsters?\" But I am pretty well off if this is the only thing that\ndiscredits my declining years. Men of all ages are admitted to this class-room. You retort: \"Do we\ngrow old merely in order to tag after the youngsters?\" But if I, an old man, go to the theatre, and am\ncarried to the races, and allow no duel in the arena to be fought to a finish without my presence,\nshall I blush to attend a philosopher's lecture?", "You should keep learning as long as you are ignorant, ? even to the end of your life, if there is\nanything in the proverb. And the proverb suits the present case as well as any: \"As long as you live,\nkeep learning how to live.\" For all that, there is also something which I can teach in that school. You\nask, do you, what I can teach? That even an old man should keep learning. But I am ashamed of\nmankind, as often as I enter the lecture-hall. On my way to the house of Metronax I am compelled to\ngo, as you know, right past the Neapolitan Theatre. The building is jammed; men are deciding, with\ntremendous zeal, who is entitled to be called a good flute-player; even the Greek piper and the\nherald draw their crowds. But in the other place, where the question discussed is: \"What is a good\nman?\" and the lesson which we learn is \"How to be a good man,\" very few are in attendance, and\nthe majority think that even these few are engaged in no good business; they have the name of\nbeing empty-headed idlers. I hope I may be blessed with that kind of mockery; for one should listen\nin an unruffled spirit to the railings of the ignorant; when one is marching toward the goal of honour,\none should scorn scorn itself.", "Proceed, then, Lucilius, and hasten, lest you yourself be compelled to learn in your old age, as is the\ncase with me. Nay, you must hasten all the more, because for a long time you have not approached\nthe subject, which is one that you can scarcely learn thoroughly when you are old. \"How much\nprogress shall I make?\" you ask. Just as much as you try to make. Why do you wait? Wisdom\ncomes haphazard to no man. Money will come of its own accord; titles will be given to you; influence\nand authority will perhaps be thrust upon you; but virtue will not fall upon you by chance. Neither is\nknowledge thereof to be won by light effort or small toil; but toiling is worth while when one is about\nto win all goods at a single stroke. For there is but a single good, ? namely, that which is\nhonourable; in all those other things of which the general opinion approves, you will find no truth or\ncertainty. Why it is, however, that there is but one good, namely, that which is honourable, I shall\nnow tell you, inasmuch as you judge that in my earlier letter I did not carry the discussion far\nenough, and think that this theory was commended to you rather than proved. I shall also compress\nthe remarks of other authors into narrow compass.", "Everything is estimated by the standard of its own good. The vine is valued for its productiveness\nand the flavour of its wine, the stag for his speed. We ask, with regard to beasts of burden, how\nsturdy of back they are; for their only use is to bear burdens. If a dog is to find the trail of a wild\nbeast, keenness of scent is of first importance; if to catch his quarry, swiftness of foot; if to attack\nand harry it, courage. In each thing that quality should be best for which the thing is brought into\nbeing and by which it is judged. And what quality is best in man? It is reason; by virtue of reason he\nsurpasses the animals, and is surpassed only by the gods. Perfect reason is therefore the good\npeculiar to man; all other qualities he shares in some degree with animals and plants. Man is strong;\nso is the lion. Man is comely; so is the peacock. Man is swift; so is the horse. I do not say that man\nis surpassed in all these qualities. I am not seeking to find that which is greatest in him, but that\nwhich is peculiarly his own. Man has body; so also have trees. Man has the power to act and to\nmove at will; so have beasts and worms. Man has a voice; but how much louder is the voice of the\ndog, how much shriller that of the eagle, how much deeper that of the bull, how much sweeter and\nmore melodious that of the nightingale! What then is peculiar to man? Reason. When this is right\nand has reached perfection, man's felicity is complete. Hence, if everything is praiseworthy and has\narrived at the end intended by its nature, when it has brought its peculiar good to perfection, and if\nman's peculiar good is reason; then, if a man has brought his reason to perfection, he is\npraiseworthy and has reached the end suited to his nature. This perfect reason is called virtue, and\nis likewise that which is honourable."]}
